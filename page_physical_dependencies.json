The most banal functions of the library require only an AVR or SAMD processor, but making real use of this library requires:</p><ul><li>A sufficiently powerful AVR or SAMD processor mounted on some sort of circuit board. (See <a href=\"page_processor_compatibility.html\" class=\"m-doc\">Processor/Board Compatibility</a> for more details on specific processors and boards that are supported.)<ul><li>For all AVR processors, you must also have a <a href=\"https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/digital/real-time-clocks/DS3231.html\">Maxim DS3231</a> high precision I2C real-time clock with the SQE/INT pin connected to a pin on your processor which supports either external or pin-change interrupts.</li><li>For SAMD boards, this library makes use of their on-board (though less accurate) real-time clock.</li></ul></li><li>A SD card reader attached to the processor via SPI.</li><li>Environmental sensors</li><li>A battery to power the system</li><li>A solar charging circuit</li><li>A modem-type unit to communicate remote data (Optional for logging data, but required for sending data directly to the internet.<ul><li>The list of supported modems is available here: <a href=\"https://envirodiy.github.io/ModularSensors/index.html#mainpage_modems\">https://envirodiy.github.io/ModularSensors/index.html#mainpage_<wbr />modems</a></li></ul></li><li>Protected water-proof enclosures and mountings for all of the above</li><li>An OTG cable to connect serial output from the board to a cell phone (Optional, but very helpful for debugging.)</li></ul>",
