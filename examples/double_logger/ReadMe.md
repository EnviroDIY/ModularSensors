# Multiple Time Intervals<!-- {#example_double_log} -->

This is a more complicated example using two different logger instances to log data at two different intervals, in this case, an AM3215 logging every minute, while checking the battery voltage only every 5 minutes.
This showcases both how to use two different logging instances and how to use some of the functions to set up your own logging loop rather than using the logData() function.

## Unique Features of the Double Logger Example<!-- {#example_double_log_unique} -->

- Two different variable arrays and loggers are created and used.
  - The Variables for the arrays are created within the array.
  - There is no variable overlap between the two arrays or loggers.
- The `loop` function is expanded into its components rather than using the `logData` functions.
  - This demonstrates *how* to write the loop out, without using the `logData` functions.
  - This shows which functions are required for each of the two loggers and which can be used in common.

## To Use this Example<!-- {#example_double_log_using} -->

### Prepare and set up PlatformIO<!-- {#example_double_log_pio} -->

- Create a new PlatformIO project
- Replace the contents of the platformio.ini for your new project with the [platformio.ini](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EnviroDIY/ModularSensors/master/examples/double_logger/platformio.ini) file in the examples/double_logger folder on GitHub.
  - It is important that your PlatformIO configuration has the lib_ldf_mode and build flags set as they are in the example.
  - Without this, the program won't compile.
- Open [double_logger.ino](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EnviroDIY/ModularSensors/master/examples/double_logger/double_logger.ino) and save it to your computer.
  - After opening the link, you should be able to right click anywhere on the page and select "Save Page As".
  - Move it into the src directory of your project.
  - Delete main.cpp in that folder.

### Set the logger ID<!-- {#example_double_log_logger_id} -->

- Change the "XXXX" in this section of code to the loggerID assigned by Stroud:

```cpp
// Logger ID, also becomes the prefix for the name of the data file on SD card
const char *LoggerID = "XXXX";
```

### Upload!<!-- {#example_double_log_upload} -->

- Test everything at home **before** deploying out in the wild!
