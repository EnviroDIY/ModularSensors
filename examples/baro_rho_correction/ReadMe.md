# Example using the Modular Sensors Library to Calculate Results based on Measured Values and Send Both Measured and Calculated Values to the EnviroDIY Data Portal

This example demonstrates how to work with calculated variables and calculates water depth by correcting the total pressure measured by a MeaSpec MS5803 with the atmospheric pressure measured by a Bosch BME280 environmental sensor and the temperature measured by a Maxim DS18 temperature probe.

The modem used in this example is a SIM800 based Sodaq GPRSBee r6.

The sensors used in this example are a Maxim DS18 temperature probe, a Bosch BME280 environmental sensor, and a Measurement Specialties MS5803-14BA Pressure Sensor.
