# Simple Logging<!-- {#example_simple_logging} -->

This shows the simplest use of a "logger" object.
That is, creating an array of variable objects and then creating a logger object that utilizes those variables to update all of the variable results together and save the data to a SD card.
The processor then goes to sleep between readings.

This is the example you should use to deploy a logger somewhere where you don't want or have access to a way of streaming live data and you won't want to upload data to the Monitor My Watershed data portal.

## Unique Features of the Simple Logging Example<!-- {#example_simple_logging_unique} -->

- Only logs data to an SD card.

## To Use this Example<!-- {#example_simple_logging_using} -->

### Prepare and set up PlatformIO<!-- {#example_simple_logging_pio} -->

- Create a new PlatformIO project
- Replace the contents of the platformio.ini for your new project with the [platformio.ini](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EnviroDIY/ModularSensors/master/examples/simple_logging/platformio.ini) file in the examples/simple_logging folder on GitHub.
  - It is important that your PlatformIO configuration has the lib_ldf_mode and build flags set as they are in the example.
  - Without this, the program won't compile.
- Open [simple_logging.ino](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EnviroDIY/ModularSensors/master/examples/simple_logging/simple_logging.ino) and save it to your computer.  Put it into the src directory of your project.
  - Delete main.cpp in that folder.

### Set the logger ID<!-- {#example_simple_logging_logger_id} -->

- Change the "XXXX" in this section of code to the loggerID assigned by Stroud:

```cpp
// Logger ID, also becomes the prefix for the name of the data file on SD card
const char *LoggerID = "XXXX";
```

### Upload!<!-- {#example_simple_logging_upload} -->

- Test everything at home **before** deploying out in the wild!
