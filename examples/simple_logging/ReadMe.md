# Example using the Modular Sensors Library to save data to an SD card

This shows the simplest use of a "logger" object.  That is, creating an array of variable objects and then creating a logger object that utilizes those variables to update all of the variable results together and save the data to a SD card.  The processor then goes to sleep between readings.  This example has a placeholder to show users where to insert sensors, which can be found in menu_a_la_carte.ino. 

This is the example you should use to deploy a logger somewhere where you don't want or have access to a way of streaming live data and you won't want to upload data to the WikiWatershed data portal.
