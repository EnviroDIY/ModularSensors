If you are using any custom code (or a &quot;complex loop&quot;) you <strong>must</strong> remember to reset your pin modes on wake. Reset pin modes by calling the <code>pinMode(pin_number, state);</code> and <code>digitalWrite(pin_number, value);</code> functions.</p></aside><aside class=\"m-note m-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>You can disable pin tri-state by calling <code>Logger::disablePinTristate(true)</code>. You can re-enable pin tri-strate by calling <code>Logger::disablePinTristate(false)</code>. No pin modes are <strong>not</strong> changed when the <code>disablePinTristate()</code> function is called, only when the <code>systemSleep()</code> function is called.</p></aside><p>To prevent power draw by any external pins during sleep, Modular Sensors sets all pins except the RTC interrupt pins to &quot;tri-state.&quot; Tri-state means that for <em>all</em> pins:</p><ul><li>the pin &quot;direction&quot; is set to input (<code>PORT-&gt;Group[port].DIRCLR.reg = pinMask;</code>)</li><li>the pin input buffer is disabled (<code>PORT-&gt;Group[port].PINCFG[pin].bit.INEN = 0;</code>)</li><li>the internal pin pull-up and pull-down resistors are disabled (<code>PORT-&gt;Group[port].PINCFG[pin].bit.PULLEN = 0;</code>)</li></ul></section><section id=\"sleep_peripherals_samd51\"><h3>SAMD51 Peripheral Clocks During Sleep</h3><aside class=\"m-note m-danger\"><h4>Warning</h4><p>This could potential be a problem if you are using an uncommon SAMD peripheral, especially if you are configuring it yourself. Some SAMD libraries that rely on the SAMD51 peripheral system configure the peripheral clocks on each call to the peripheral, but some do it only on when a <code>begin()</code> type function is called. If the peripheral you wish to use always reconfigures the clocks, this will never be a problem for you. If not, you will need to call whatever function is needed to reconfigure the clocks on wake.</p></aside><aside class=\"m-note m-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>You can disable disabling peripherals by calling <code>Logger::disablePeripheralShutdown(true)</code>. You can re-enable pin tri-strate by calling <code>Logger::disablePeripheralShutdown(false)</code>. No peripheral settings are changed when the <code>disablePeripheralShutdown()</code> function is called, only when the <code>systemSleep()</code> function is called.</p></aside><p>To decrease power use during sleep on the SAMD51, Modular Sensors explicitly disconnects all unused peripherals from the various clocks and and clock sources to prevent them from &quot;[sleepwalking](https://onlinedocs.microchip.com/oxy/GUID-F5813793-E016-46F5-A9E2-718D8BCED496-en-US-14/GUID-FA7D618C-0F98-4A2C-9D24-669C4A3E3CA3.html)&quot;. The SAMD51&#x27;s standby mode turns off clocks <em>except those configured to be running sleepwalking tasks</em>. By disconnecting all unused peripherals from a clock source, we ensure that the clocks aren&#x27;t woken.</p><p>To do this, Modular Sensors disables generic clock generator 7 by disconnecting it from any oscillator source. Then it ties all peripheral timer that are safe to shut down to the disabled generator. This reduces power draw in sleep.</p><p>Some notes on what can and cannot be disabled:</p><ul><li>We CAN disable the EIC controller timer (4) because the controller clock source is set to OSCULP32K.</li><li>We cannot disable the SERCOM peripheral timers for sleep because they&#x27;re only reset with a begin(speed, config), which we do not call within the Modular Sensors library. We force users to call the begin in their sketch so they can choose both the exact type of stream and the baud rate.</li><li>We cannot disable the ADC peripheral timers because they&#x27;re only set in the init for the ADC at startup.</li><li>We CAN disable all of the timer clocks because they&#x27;re reset every time they&#x27;re used by SDI-12 (and others)</li></ul><p>The numbers of all disabled peripherals are:</p><ul><li>4, 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,</li><li>18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30,</li><li>31, 32, 33, 38, 39, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47</li></ul><aside class=\"m-note m-default\"><h4>See also</h4><p><a href=\"page_samd_clocks.html#samd51_clock_other_libraries\" class=\"m-doc\">The SAMD clock file</a> for a list of which peripherals each of these numbers pertain to.</p></aside></section><section id=\"sleep_fxn_samd51\"><h3>Steps in Putting an SAMD51 board to sleep</h3><p>After completing the <a href=\"#sleep-_configurations_steps-for-putting-all-boards-to-sleep\" class=\"m-doc\">steps for putting all boards to sleep</a> SAMD51 boards finish their bedtime routine with these steps.</p><ul><li>Detach any USB devices (ie, the built in USB drivers for communication with a PC)<ul><li>This is skipped if the TinyUSB library is called for some reason.</li></ul></li><li>Force all pins except the RTC wake and button pins to go to minimum power draw levels (tri-state)</li><li>Configure GCLK7 to be disconnected from an oscillator source.</li><li>Connect all unused peripherals to the source-less GCLK7.</li><li>Wait for all serial ports to finish transmitting<ul><li>This is crucial for the SAMD boards that will continuously wake if they have data remaining in the buffer.</li></ul></li><li>Clear the FPU interrupt because it can prevent us from sleeping.<ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/maholli/circuitpython/blob/210ce1d1dc9b1c6c615ff2d3201dde89cb75c555/ports/atmel-samd/supervisor/port.c#L654\">See this reference in the Circuit Python code.</a></li></ul></li><li>Set the sleep mode configuration to use STANDBY mode.</li><li>Wait for the sleep mode setting to take<ul><li>From datasheet 18.6.3.3: A small latency happens between the store instruction and actual writing of the SLEEPCFG register due to bridges.
