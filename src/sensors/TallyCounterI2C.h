 * @section sensor_tally_intro Introduction
 * Northern Widget's Tally is
 * > a minimal ultra low power digital event counter, designed to be a
 * > counterpart to a traditional data logger to measure and average rapid
 * > events like an anemometer reading.
 * It communicates over I2C at either 3.3 or 5V.
 *
 * The [Tally_Library]
 * (https://github.com/EnviroDIY/Tally_Library/tree/Dev_I2C)
 * is used internally for communication with the Tally.
 *
 * @warning Northern Widget considers this sensor to be one of their "bleeding edge"
 * sensors.  As such, it is subject to change at any time.  This library may not
 * be updated immediately to reflect changes on the part of Northern Widget.
 *
 * @warning As an event counter, the Tally should be continuously powered (at 3.3V or 5V).
 * It does have a large on-board capacitor which can act as a battery to ride out power
 * shortages, but that shouldn't be expected to perform as a long-term solution.
 * If you do chose to switch the power for the Tally counter, be very conscious
 * of the fact that the library is designed to run power this (and all other) sensors
 * for the very minimum amount of time possible to get a reading.
 * This means the capacitor will be running at a very low duty cycle;
 * likely less than 1% if the sensors are only powered a few seconds every few minutes.
 * A super-capacitor is *NOT* an instantly charged battery and will not keep the counter
 * powered at too low a duty cycle.
