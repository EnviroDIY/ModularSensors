 * @section sensor_sht4x_intro Introduction
 *
 * > SHT4x is a digital sensor platform for measuring relative humidity and
 * > temperature at different accuracy classes. The I2C interface  provides
 * > several preconfigured I2C addresses and maintains an ultra-low power
 * > budget. The power-trimmed internal heater can be used at three heating
 * > levels thus enabling sensor operation in demanding environments.
 *

 * - The code for this library should work for 0x44 addressed SHT4x sensors - the SHT40, SHT41, and SHT45.
 * - Depends on the [Adafruit SHT4x Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SHT40).
 * - Communicates via I2C
 *   - There are versions of the SHT40, SHT40-AD1B with the I2C address 0x44
 * and SHT40-BD1B with the I2C address 0x45.
 * **This library only supports the 0x44 addressed sensor!**
 *   - The SHT41 and SHT45 only have one possible address, 0x44.
 * - **Only 1 can be connected to a single I2C bus at a time**
 * - Requires a 3.3 power source
 *
 * @note Software I2C is *not* supported for the SHT4x.
 * A secondary hardware I2C on a SAMD board is supported.
