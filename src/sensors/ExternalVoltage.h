 * This file is for the grove voltage divider (but will work with any voltage
 * divider with an output in the range of 0 ~ 3.3v)
 * This is dependent on the soligen2010 fork of the Adafruit ADS1015 library.
 *
 * The grove voltage divider is a simple voltage divider designed to measure
 * high external voltages on a low voltage ADC. This module employs a variable
 * gain via two pairs of voltage dividers, and a unity gain amplification to
 * reduce output impedance of the module.
 *
 * Range:
 *   NOTE:  Range is determined by supply voltage - No more than VDD + 0.3 V or
 *          5.5 V (whichever is smaller) must be applied to this device.
 *   without voltage divider:  0 - 3.6V [when ADC is powered at 3.3V]
 *   1/gain = 3x: 0.3 ~ 12.9V
 *   1/gain = 10x: 1 ~ 43V
 * Accuracy:
 *   16-bit ADC: < 0.25% (gain error), <0.25 LSB (offset errror)
 *   12-bit ADC: < 0.15% (gain error), <3 LSB (offset errror)
 * Resolution:
 *   NOTE:  1 bit of resolution is lost in single-ended reading.  The maximum
 *          possible resolution is over the differential range from
 *          negative to positive full scale, a single ended reading is only over
 *          the range from 0 to positive full scale)
 *   NOTE:  Assuming the ADC is powered at 3.3V, this program sets the the ACD's
 *          inbuilt gain to 1, which divides the bit resolution over range of
 *          0-4.096V
 *   16-bit ADC:
 *     without voltage divider:  0.125 mV
 *     1/gain = 3x: 0.375 mV
 *     1/gain = 10x: 1.25 mV
 *   12-bit ADC:
 *     without voltage divider:  2 mV
 *     1/gain = 3x: 6 mV
 *     1/gain = 10x: 20 mV
