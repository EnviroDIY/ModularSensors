# ModularSensors

This Arduino library gives environmental sensors a common interface of functions for use with Arduino-compatible dataloggers, such as the EnviroDIY Mayfly. The ModularSensors library is specifically designed to support wireless, solar-powered environmental data logging applications, that is, to:
* Retrieve data from many physical sensors;
* Save that data to a SD memory card;
* Transmit that data wirelessly to a web server; and
* Put the processor, sensors and all other peripherals to sleep between readings to conserver power.

The ModularSensors library coordinates these tasks by "wrapping" native sensor and variable functions into a common interface of functions and returns. These [wrapper functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrapper_function) serve to harmonize and simplify the process of iterating through and logging data from a diverse set of sensors and variables.

Although this library was written primarily for the [EnviroDIY Mayfly data logger board](https://envirodiy.org/mayfly/), it is also designed to be [compatible with a variety of other Arduino-based boards](#compatibility) as well.

## <a name="getStarted"></a>Getting Started

Get started by reading this section, collecting the [Physical Dependencies](#pdeps), and installing the [Library Dependencies](#ldeps).  Then try out one of our sketches in the [Examples](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/ModularSensors/tree/master/examples) folder.

To use a sensor and variable in your sketch, you must separately include xxx.h for each sensor you intend to use.  While this may force you to write many more include statements, it decreases the library RAM usage on your Arduino board.  Regardless of how many sensors you intend to use, however, you must install all of the [dependent libraries](#ldeps) on your _computer_ for the Arduino software, PlatformIO or any other Integrated Development Environment (IDE) software to be able to compile the library.

Each sensor is implemented as a subclass of the "Sensor" class contained in "SensorBase.h".  Each variable is separately implemented as a subclass of the "Variable" class contained in "VariableBase.h".  The variables are tied to the sensor using an "[Observer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern)" software pattern.



### <a name="whatHo"></a>What are sensors and variables?

Within this library, a sensor, a variable, and a logger mean very specific things:

**Sensor** - A sensor is some sort of device that is capable of taking one or more measurements using some sort of method.  Most often we can think of these as probes or other instruments that can give back information about the world around them.  Sensors can usually be given power or have that power cut.  They may be awoken or activated and then returned to a sleeping/low power use state.  The may be able to be asked to begin a single reading.  They _**must**_ be capable of returning the value of their readings to a logger of some type.

**Variable** - A variable is a single measurement value taken by a sensor.  It is characterized by a name (what it is a measurement of), a unit of measurement, and a resolution.  The [names](http://vocabulary.odm2.org/variablename/) and [units](http://vocabulary.odm2.org/units/) of measurements for all variables come from the controlled vocabularies developed for the ODM2 data system.  (http://vocabulary.odm2.org/)  The resolution is determined by the method used to take the measurement by the sensor.  A variable may also be assigned a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) and a unique variable code.  Many sensors are capable of measuring multiple variables at a single time.  For example, a Decagon CTD-10 is a _sensor_.  It is able to measure 3 _variables_: specific conductance, temperature, and water depth.  The variable named "specificConductance" has _units_ of microsiemens per centimeter (µS/cm) and a _resolution_ of 1 µS/cm.  Each variable is explicitly tied to the "parent" sensor that "notifies" the variable when a new value has been measured.

**Logger** - A logger is a device that can control all functions of the sensors that are attached to it and save the values of all variables measured by those sensors to an attached SD card.  In this library, all loggers are Arduino-style small processor circuit boards.

**Modem** - A modem is a device that can be controlled by a logger to send out data directly to the world wide web.



### <a name="pdeps"></a>Physical Dependencies

This library is designed for wireless, solar-powered environmental data logging applications, that is, to log data from many physical sensors and to put the processor and all peripherals to sleep to conserver power between readings.  The most banal functions of the library require only an AVR or SAMD processor, but making real use of this library requires:

- A sufficiently powerful AVR or SAMD processor mounted on some sort of circuit board.  (See [Processor/Board Compatibility](#compatibility) for more details on specific processors and boards that are supported.)
    - For all AVR processors, you must also have a [Maxim DS3231](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/digital/real-time-clocks/DS3231.html) high precision I2C real-time clock with the SQE/INT pin connected to a pin on your processor which supports either external or pin-change interrupts.
    - For SAMD boards, this library makes use of their on-board (though less accurate) real-time clock.
- A SD card reader attached to the processor via SPI.
- Environmental sensors
- A battery to power the system
- A solar charging circuit
- A modem-type unit to communicate remote data (Optional for logging data, but required for sending data directly to the internet.  See [Modem and Internet Functions](#Modem) for supported models.)
- Protected water-proof enclosures and mountings for all of the above
- An OTG cable to connect serial output from the board to a cell phone (Optional, but very helpful for debugging.)

### <a name="ldeps"></a>Library Dependencies

In order to support multiple functions and sensors, there are quite a lot of sub-libraries that this library is dependent on.  _Even if you do not use the modules, you must have all of the dependencies installed for the library itself to properly compile._

- [EnableInterrupt](https://github.com/GreyGnome/EnableInterrupt) - Administrates and handles pin change interrupts, allowing the logger to sleep and save battery.  This also controls the interrupts for the versions of SoftwareSerial and SDI-12 linked below that have been stripped of interrupt control.  Because we use this library, _you must always add the line ```#include <EnableInterrupt.h>``` to the top of your sketch._
- AVR sleep library - This is for low power sleeping for AVR processors. (This library is built in to the Arduino IDE.)
- [EnviroDIY DS-3231](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/Sodaq_DS3231) - For real time clock control
- [RTCZero library](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/RTCZero) - This real time clock control and low power sleeping on SAMD processors. (This library may be built in to the Arduino IDE.)
- [SdFat library](https://github.com/greiman/SdFat) - This enables communication with the SD card.
- [EnviroDIY version of the TinyGSM library](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/TinyGSM) - This provides internet (TCP/IP) connectivity.
- [Adafruit ADS1X15 library](https://github.com/soligen2010/Adafruit_ADS1X15/) - For high-resolution analog to digital conversion.  Note that this is soligen2010's fork of the original Adafruit library; it corrects many problems in the Adafruit library such as a bug which gives the same output on all four inputs regardless of their values.  Do NOT use the original Adafruit version!
- [EnviroDIY Arduino SDI-12 library](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/Arduino-SDI-12/tree/ExtInts) - For control of SDI-12 based sensors.  This modified version is needed so there are no pin change interrupt conflicts with the SoftwareSerial library or the software pin change interrupt library used to wake the processor.
- [SensorModbusMaster](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/SensorModbusMaster) - for easy communication with Modbus devices.
- [OneWire](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/OneWire) - This enables communication with Maxim/Dallas OneWire devices.
- [DallasTemperature](https://github.com/milesburton/Arduino-Temperature-Control-Library) - for communication with the DS18 line of Maxim/Dallas OneWire temperature probes.
- [Adafruit Unified Sensor Driver](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Sensor) - a dependency of several other Adafruit libraries
- [Adafruit AM2315 library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_AM2315) - for the AOSong AM2315 temperature and humidity sensor.
- [Adafruit DHT library](https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library) - for other AOSong temperature and humidity sensors.
- [Adafruit BME280 library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_BME280_Library) - for the Bosch BME280 environmental sensor.
- [Adafruit MPL115A2 library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MPL115A2) - for the Freescale Semiconductor MPL115A2 barometer.
- [YosemitechModbus](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/YosemitechModbus) - for all Yosemitech environmental sensor.
- [EnviroDIY MS5803 Library](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/MS5803) - for the TE Connectivity MEAS MS5803 pressure sensor

## <a name="Basic"></a>Basic Sensor and Variable Functions

### Functions Available for Each Sensor
Generally useful functions:
- **Constructor** - Each sensor has a unique constructor, the exact format of which is dependent on the individual sensor.
- **getSensorName()** - This gets the name of the sensor and returns it as a string.
- **getSensorLocation()** - This returns the Arduino pin sending and receiving data or other sensor installation information as a string.  This is the location where the sensor is connected to the data logger, NOT the position of the sensor in the environment.  Generally this value is set in the constructor for the sensor.
- **setNumberMeasurementsToAverage(int nReadings)** - Sets the number of readings for the sensor to take.  This value can also be set by the constructor.
- **getNumberMeasurementsToAverage()** - Returns an unsigned 8-bit integer with the number of readings the sensor will be taking before averaging and giving a final result.
- **getStatus()** - This returns the 8-bit code for the current status of the sensor:
    - Bit 0 - 0=Not powered, 1=Powered
    - Bit 1 - 0=Has NOT been set up, 1=Has been setup
    - Bit 2 - 0=Is NOT warmed up, 1=Is warmed up
    - Bit 3 - 0=Not awake/actively measuring, 1=Is awake/actively measuring
    - Bit 4 - 0=Readings not stable, 1=Readings should be stable
    - Bit 5 - 0=Measurement requested, 1=No measurements have been requested
    - Bit 6 - 1=Waiting for measurement completion (IFF bit 3 and 4 are set!), 1=Measurement complete (IFF bit 3 and 4 are set!),
    - Bit 7 - 0=No known errors, 1=Some sort of error has occurred
- **updateStatusBits()** - This function checks the current status.
- **setup()** - This "sets up" the sensor - setting up serial ports, etc required for the given sensor.  This must always be called for each sensor within the "setup" loop of your Arduino program _before_ calling the corresponding variable setup.
- **update()** - This updates the sensor values and returns true when finished.  For digital sensors with a single information return, this only needs to be called once for each sensor, even if there are multiple variable subclasses for the sensor.  In general, the update function powers the sensor, wakes/activates it, tells it to start measurements and get values as many times as requested, averages all the values, notifies the attached variables that new values are available, and then puts the sensor back to sleep if it had been asleep at the start of the update.

These functions are also available for each sensor, but should be used with caution.  These functions do not have any built in waits or checks to ensure they are executed in the correct order.  _**For most purposes, you should use the update function!**_  All of these functions are intended to maximize efficiency when using many variables from many sensors together in a [VariableArray](#Grouped).
- **powerUp()** - This sends power to the sensor.  No return.
- **powerDown()** - This cuts the sensor power.  No return.
- **wake()** - This wakes up/activates the sensor up so it is in the state it needs to be to begin taking measurements.  Returns true if successful.  You must remember to first powerUp() the sensor if necessary and allow enough time between the powerUp() and the wake() for the sensor to be ready to respond or call the waitForWarmUp() function.
- **sleep()** - This puts the sensor to sleep/de-activates it, but does NOT power it down.  Returns true if successful.
- **startSingleMeasurement()** - This tells the sensor to start a single measurement.  Returns true if successful.  Before calling this function, ensure that the sensor has power, has been activated, and you have waited long enough for the readings to be stable.  (Use the waitForStability() function as necessary.)
- **addSingleMeasurementResult()** - This gets the results from a single measurement that has already been started.  Returns true if successful.  This function is the heart of what every sensor object does.  When creating a new sensor object type, this function and the constructor are the only functions that must be uniquely implemented.
- **clearValues()** - Clears the result values array for a sensor
- **verifyAndAddMeasurementResult()** - This verifies that a measurement is OK (ie, not -9999) before adding it to the sensor's result array.  This is used to prevent real values from being averaged with -9999 returns.
- **averageMeasurements()** - Averages the values in the sensor's result array.
- **notifyVariables()** - Notifies attached variables of new values.  It is the sensor's job to notify variables!
- **registerVariable()** - The compliment to a variable's "attachSensor(int varNum, Sensor \*parentSense)" function.  These functions tie the variable and sensor together.  This is generally called by the variable, not by the sensor.
- **checkPowerOn()** - Returns true if a sensors assigned power pin is currently "HIGH."
- **isWarmedUp()** - Checks whether or not enough time has passed between the sensor receiving power and being ready to respond to logger commands.
- **waitForWarmUp()** - Delays until time is passed for sensor warm-up.
- **isStable()** - Checks whether or not enough time has passed between the sensor being awoken/activated and being ready to output stable values.
- **waitForStability()** - Delays until time is passed for sensor stability.
- **isMeasurementComplete()** - Checks whether or not enough time has passed between when the sensor was asked to take a single measurement and when that measurement should be complete.
- **waitForMeasurementCompletion()** - Delays until time is passed for measurement completion.

### Functions for Each Variable
- **Constructor** - Every variable requires a pointer to its parent sensor as part of the constructor.  Every variable also has two optional string entries, for a universally unique identifier (UUID/GUID) and a custom variable code.  _The UUID must always be listed first!_  In cases where you would like a custom variable code, but do not have a UUID, you **must** enter '""' as your UUID.
- **getVarName()** - This returns the variable's name ,using http://vocabulary.odm2.org/variablename/, as a String.
- **getVarUnit()** - This returns the variable's unit, using http://vocabulary.odm2.org/units/, as a String.
- **getVarCode()** - This returns a String with a customized code for the variable, if one is given, and a default if not
- **getVarUUID()** - This returns the universally unique identifier of a variables, if one is assigned, as a String
- **setup()** - This "sets up" the variable - attaching it to its parent sensor.  This must always be called for each sensor within the "setup" loop of your Arduino program _after_ calling the sensor setup.
- **getValue(bool updateValue)** - This returns the current value of the variable as a float.  By default, it does not ask the parent sensor for a new value, but simply returns the last value a parent sensor notified it of, no matter the age of the value.  If you would like to ask the sensor to measure a new value and for that new value to be returned, set the boolean flag as true.
- **getValueString(bool updateValue)** - This is identical to getValue, except that it returns a string with the proper precision available from the sensor.
- **attachSensor(int varNum, Sensor \*parentSense)** - The compliment to a sensor's registerVariable() function.  This attaches a variable object to the sensor that is giving the value to the variable.  The variable is generally responsible for calling this function!
- **onSensorUpdate()** - This is the variable's response to the sensor's notifyVariables() function.  It accepts the new value from the sensor.  This is generally called by the sensor.

### <a name="individuals"></a>Examples Using Individual Sensor and Variable Functions
To access and get values from a sensor, you must create an instance of the sensor class you are interested in using its constructor.  Each variable has different parameters that you must specify; these are described below within the section for each sensor.  You must then create a new instance for each _variable_, and reference a pointer to the parent sensor in the constructor.  Many variables can (and should) call the same parent sensor.  The variables are specific to the individual sensor because each sensor collects data and returns data in a unique way.  The constructors are all best called outside of the "setup()" or "loop()" functions.  The setup functions are then called (sensor, then variables) in the main "setup()" function and the update() and getValues() are called in the loop().  A very simple program to get data from a Decagon CTD might be something like:

```cpp
#include <DecagonCTD.h>
const char *CTDSDI12address = "1";  // The SDI-12 Address of the CTD
const uint8_t measurementsToAverage = 10;  // The number of readings to average
const int SDI12Data = 7;  // The pin the CTD is attached to
const int SDI12Power = 22;  // The sensor power pin (use -1 if not applicable)
DecagonCTD ctd(*CTDSDI12address, SDI12Power, SDI12Data, measurementsToAverage);
DecagonCTD_Cond cond(&ctd);  // The ampersand (&) *must* be included
DecagonCTD_Temp temp(&ctd);
DecagonCTD_Depth depth(&ctd);

setup()
{
    // Start the primary serial connection
    Serial.begin(SERIAL_BAUD);

    // Set up the sensor first and then the variables
    ctd.setup();
    cond.setup();
    temp.setup();
    depth.setup();
}

loop()
{
    ctd.update();
    Serial.print("Current conductivity: ");
    Serial.println(cond.getValue());
    Serial.print("Current temperature: ");
    Serial.println(temp.getValue());
    Serial.print("Current water depth: ");
    Serial.println(depth.getValue());
    delay(15000);
}
```

The "[single_sensor](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/ModularSensors/tree/master/examples/single_sensor)" example in the examples folder shows the same functionality for a MaxBotix Ultrasonic Range Finder.

## <a name="Grouped"></a>Grouped Sensor Functions
Having a unified set of functions to access many sensors allows us to quickly poll through a list of sensors to get all results quickly.  To this end, "VariableArray.h" adds the class "VariableArray" with functions to use on an array of pointers to variable objects.

### Functions Available for a VariableArray Object:
- **init(int variableCount, Variable variableList[])** - This initializes the variable array.  This must be called in the setup() function.  Note that the objects in the variable list must be pointers, not the variable objects themselves.
- **getVariableCount()** - Simply returns the number of variables.
- **getSensorCount()** - Returns the number of independent sensors.  This will often be different from the number of variables because many sensors can return multiple variables.
- **setupSensors()** - This sets up all of the variables in the array and their respective sensors by running all of their setup() functions.  If a sensor doesn't respond to its setup command, the command is called 5 times in attempt to make a connection.  If all sensors are set up successfully, returns true.
- **sensorsPowerUp()** - This gives power to all sensors, skipping repeated sensors.  No return.
- **sensorsWake()** - This wakes all sensors, skipping repeated sensors.  Returns true.
- **sensorsSleep()** - This puts all sensors to sleep, skipping repeated sensors.  Returns true.
- **sensorsPowerDown()** - This cuts power to all sensors, skipping repeated sensors.  No return.
- **updateAllSensors()** - This updates all sensor values, skipping repeated sensors.  Returns true.  Does NOT return any values.
- **printSensorData(Stream stream)** - This prints current sensor values along with meta-data to a stream (either hardware or software serial).  By default, it will print to the first Serial port.  Note that the input is a pointer to a stream instance so to use a hardware serial instance you must use an ampersand before the serial name (ie, &Serial1).
- **generateSensorDataCSV()** - This returns an Arduino String containing comma separated list of sensor values.  This string does _NOT_ contain a time stamp of any kind.

### <a name="ArrayExamples"></a>VariableArray Examples:

To use the VariableArray module, you must first create the array of pointers.  This should be done outside of the setup() or loop() functions.  Remember that you must create a new instance for each variable and each sensor.  The sensor functions for sensors within a variable array take advantage of all of the timestamps and status bits within the sensor object to minimize the amount of time that all sensors are powered and the processor is awake.  That is, the first sensor to be warmed up will be set up or activated first; the first sensor to stabilize will be asked for values first.  The order of the variables within the array should not matter, though for code readability, I strongly suggest putting all the variables attached to a single sensor next to each other in the array.

Following the example from above, with a Decagon CTD, you would create an array with the three CTD variables like this:

```cpp
// Create a new VariableArray object
VariableArray myVars;
// Create the array of variables named "variableList" using the pre-created variable objects
Variable \*variableList[] = {\*cond, \*temp, \*depth};
// Optionally, count the number of variables in the array (in this case, it's 3)
int variableCount = sizeof(variableList) / sizeof(variableList[0]);
```

The asterisk must be put in front of the variable name to indicate that it is a pointer to your variable object.  With many variables, it is easier to create the object and the pointer to it all at once in the variable array.  This can be done using the "new" keyword like so:

```cpp
// Create a new VariableArray object
VariableArray myVars;
// Create new variable objects in an array named "variableList" using the "new" keyword
// UUID's and customVarCodes are optional
Variable \*variableList[] = {
    new Sensor1_Variable1(&parentSensor1, "UUID", "customVarCode1"),
    new Sensor1_Variable2(&parentSensor1, "UUID", "customVarCode2"),
    new Sensor2_Variable1(&parentSensor2, "UUID", "customVarCode3"),
    ...
    new SensorX_VariableX(&parentSensorx, "UUID", "customVarCode4")
};
// Optionally, count the number of variables in the array
int variableCount = sizeof(variableList) / sizeof(variableList[0]);
```

Once you have created the array of pointers, you can initialize the VariableArray module and setup all of the sensors at once in the setup function:

```cpp
// Initialize the sensor array;
myVars.init(variableCount, variableList);
// Set up all the sensors AND variables (BOTH are done by this function)
myVars.setupSensors();
```

You can then get values or variable names for all of the sensors within the loop with calls like:

```cpp
// Update the sensor value(s)
myVars.updateAllSensors();
// Print the data to the screen
myVars.printSensorData();
```

## <a name="Logger"></a>Basic Logger Functions
Our main reason to unify the output from many sensors and variables is to easily log the data to an SD card and to send it to a live streaming data receiver, like the [MonitorMyWatershed/EnviroDIY data portal](http://data.envirodiy.org/).  There are several modules available to use with the sensors to log data and stream data:  LoggerBase, LoggerEnviroDIY, and LoggerModem.  The classes Logger (in LoggerBase) is a sub-class of VariableArray and LoggerEnviroDIY (in LoggerEnviroDIY) is in-turn a sub-class of Logger.   They contain all of the functions available to a VariableArray as described above.  The Logger class adds the abilities to communicate with a real time clock, to put the board into deep sleep between readings to conserver power, and to write the data from the sensors to a csv file on a connected SD card.  The LoggerModem module is essentially a wrapper for [TinyGSM](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/TinyGSM) which adds quick functions for turning modem on and off to save power and to synchronize the real-time clock with the [NIST Internet time service](https://www.nist.gov/pml/time-and-frequency-division/services/internet-time-service-its).  The LoggerEnviroDIY class uses LoggerModem to add the ability to properly format and send data to the [EnviroDIY data portal](http://data.envirodiy.org/).

### Functions Available for a Logger Object:

#### Setup and initialization functions:

- **init(int SDCardPin, int mcuWakePin, int variableCount, Variable \*variableList[], float loggingIntervalMinutes, const char \*loggerID = 0)** - Initializes the logger object.  Must happen within the setup function.  Note that the variableList[], and loggerID are pointers.  The SDCardPin is the pin of the chip select/slave select for the SPI connection to the SD card.
  - NOTE regarding *loggingIntervalMinutes*: For the first 20 minutes that a logger has been powered up for a deployment, the logger will take readings at 2 minute intervals for 10 measurements, to assist with confirming that the deployment is successful. Afterwards, the time between measurements will revert to the number of minutes set with *loggingIntervalMinutes*.
- **setAlertPin(int ledPin)** - Optionally sets a pin to put out an alert that a measurement is being logged.  This is intended to be a pin with a LED on it so you can see the light come on when a measurement is being taken.

#### Timezone functions:

- **setTimeZone(int timeZone)** - Sets the timezone that you wish data to be logged in (in +/- hours from UTC).  _This must always be set!_
- **setTZOffset(int offset)** - This sets the offset between the built-in clock and the timezone the data should be logged in.  If your clock is set in UTC, then the TZOffset should be the same as the TimeZone.  For example, if you would like your clock to be set in UTC but your data should be output in Eastern Standard Time, both setTimeZone and setTZOffset should be called with -5.  On the other hand, if your clock is already set EST, you do not need to call the setTZOffset function (or can call it with 0).
A note about timezones:  It is possible to create multiple logger objects in your code if you want to log different sensors at different intervals, _but every logger object will always have the same timezone and timezone offset_.  If you attempt to call these functions more than once for different loggers, whatever value was called last will apply to every logger.

#### Functions to access the clock in proper format and time zone:

- **syncRTClock(uint32_t timestamp)** - This synchronizes the real time clock with the provided timestamp, which should be a unix timestamp _in UTC_.
- **getNow()** - This gets the current epoch time (unix timestamp - number of seconds since Jan 1, 1970) and corrects it for the specified logger time zone offset.
- **formatDateTime_ISO8601(DateTime dt)** - Formats a DateTime object into an ISO8601 formatted Arduino String.
- **formatDateTime_ISO8601(uint32_t unixTime)** - Formats a unix timestamp into an ISO8601 formatted Arduino String.
- **checkInterval()** - This returns true if the _current_ time is an even iterval of the logging interval, otherwise false.  This uses getNow() to get the curernt time.
- **markTime()** - This sets static variables for the date/time - this is needed so that all data outputs (SD, EnviroDIY, serial printing, etc) print the same time for updating the sensors - even though the routines to update the sensors and to output the data may take several seconds.  It is not currently possible to output the instantaneous time an individual sensor was updated, just a single marked time.  By custom, this should be called before updating the sensors, not after.  If you do not call this function before saving or sending data, there will be no timestamps associated with your data.  This is called for you every time the checkInterval() function is run.
- **checkMarkedInterval()** - This returns true if the _marked_ time is an even iterval of the logging interval, otherwise false.  This uses the static time value set by markTime() to get the time.  It does not check the real-time-clock directly.


#### Functions for the processor sleep modes:

- **setupSleep()** - Sets up the processor sleep mode and the interrupts to wake the processor back up.  This should be called in the setup function.
- **systemSleep()** - Puts the system into deep sleep mode.  This should be called at the very end of the loop function.  Please keep in mind that this does NOT call the wake and sleep functions of the sensors themselves; you must call those separately.  (This separation is for timing reasons.)

#### Functions for logging data:

- **setFileName(fileName)** - This sets a specified file name for data to be saved as, if you want to decide on it in advance.  Note that you must include the file extention (ie., '.txt') in the file name.  If you do not call the setFileName function with a specific name, a csv file name will automatically be generated from the logger id and the current date.
- **getFileName()** - This returns the current filename as an Arduino String.
- **setupLogFile()** - This creates a file on the SD card and writes a header to it.  It also sets the "file created" time stamp.
- **logToSD(String rec)** - This writes a data line containing "rec" the the SD card and sets the "file modified" timestamp.  
- **generateFileHeader()** - This returns and Aruduino String with a comma separated list of headers for the csv.  The headers will be ordered based on the order variables are listed in the array fed to the init function.
- **generateSensorDataCSV()** - This returns an Arduino String containing the time and a comma separated list of sensor values.  The data will be ordered based on the order variables are listed in the array fed to the init function.

#### Functions for sensor testing and communication debugging:

By default, some status and set-up information will be sent to the Serial (for AVR processors) or SerialUSB (for SAMD processors).  To stop all print out or to change the port the print out goes to, open ModSensorDebugger.h and change or remove lines 15-21 that define the STANDARD_SERIAL_OUTPUT.

There is also a built-in function for "testing" sensors within sensor arrays - that is, continuously displaying current sensor values to test that the sensors are working properly:
- **testingMode()** - Enters a "testing" mode for the sensors.  It prints out all of the sensor results for 25 records worth of data with a 5-second delay between readings.  The printouts go to whichever serial port is given in the ```#define STANDARD_SERIAL_OUTPUT``` statement.

Testing mode can be entered directly in a set-up or loop function by calling the ```testingMode()``` function.  There is also a function to hold code to wait for a button press to enter test testing mode.  I suggest only running this as the very last step of the setup function.
- **checkForTestingMode(int buttonPin)** - This stops everything and waits for five seconds for a button to be pressed to enter allow the user to enter "sensor testing" mode.

If you would like to be able to enter the testing mode via a button press at any time while the logger is asleep, you can use the testingISR() function to define an interrupt for entering testing mode.  Please note that the ISR verifies that you are not in the middle of taking/logging a measurement before beginning the testing mode, so you cannot enter testing mode during that time.  Also note that the testing mode will not return any valid results until after the full setup is complete, so don't try to enter testing mode before then.
```cpp
pinMode(pinNumber, INPUT_PULLUP);
enableInterrupt(buttonPin, Logger::testingISR, CHANGE);
```


For more intense _code_ debugging for any individual component of the library (sensor communication, modem communication, variable array functions, etc), open the source file header (\*.h), for that component.  Find the line ```// #define DEBUGGING_SERIAL_OUTPUT xxxxx```, where xxxxx is the name of a serial output (ie, Serial or USBSerial).  Remove the two comment slashes from that line.  Then recompile and upload your code.  This will (sometimes dramatically) increase the number of statements going out to the debugging serial port.  A few sensors also the line ```// #define DEEP_DEBUGGING_SERIAL_OUTPUT xxxxx```, uncommenting of which will send even more information to the defined port.  Note that this type of debugging is intended to help find errors in the code of this library, not problems with the sensors themselves!

####  Convenience functions to do it all:

- **begin()** - Starts all the sensors, the variable array, and the logger.  Must be in the setup function.
- **log()** - Logs data, must be the entire content of the loop function.

### <a name="Modem"></a>Functions for a LoggerModem:

A loggerModem serves two functions:  First, it communicates with the internet via WiFi or cellular service and sends data to remote services.  Second, it acts as a sensor which can return the strength of the WiFi or cellular connection.  A loggerModem object is a combination of a [TinyGsm](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/TinyGSM) (modem instance), a TinyGsmClient, and a ModemOnOff to control modem power.

Before creating a loggerModem instance, _you must add one of these lines to the top of your sketch_, before any include statements:

- ```#define TINY_GSM_MODEM_SIM800``` - for a SIMCom SIM800, SIM900, or variant thereof (including [Sodaq GPRSBees](https://shop.sodaq.com/en/gprsbee.html))
- ```#define TINY_GSM_MODEM_SIM808``` - for a SIMCom SIM808 (essentially a SIMCom SIM800 with GPS support)
- ```#define TINY_GSM_MODEM_A6``` - for an AI-Thinker A6 or A7
- ```#define TINY_GSM_MODEM_M590``` - for a Neoway M590
- ```#define TINY_GSM_MODEM_U201``` - for a U-blox U201 (or a Digi 3G XBee running in bypass mode)
- ```#define TINY_GSM_MODEM_ESP8266``` - for an ESP8266 using the _default AT command firmware_
- ```#define TINY_GSM_MODEM_XBEE``` - for Digi brand WiFi or Cellular XBee's running in normal (transparent) mode

Then you must create the modem object:

```cpp
// Create the modem object
loggerModem modem;
```

See [TinyGSM's documentation](https://github.com/vshymanskyy/TinyGSM/blob/master/README.md) for a full list of all of the chip variants and modules that are supported.

After defining your modem, set it up using one of these two commands, depending on whether you are using cellular or WiFi communication:

- **setupModem(Stream modemStream, int vcc33Pin, int modemStatusPin, int modemSleepRqPin, ModemSleepType sleepType, const char \*APN)** - Sets up the internet communcation with a cellular modem.  Note that the modemStream and APN should be pointers.  Use -1 for any pins that are not connected.
- **setupModem(Stream modemStream, int vcc33Pin, int modemStatusPin, int modemSleepRqPin, ModemSleepType sleepType, const char \*ssid, const char \*pwd)** - Sets up the internet communication with a WiFi modem.  Note that the modemStream, ssid, and password should be pointers.  Use -1 for any pins that are not connected.
- The **vcc33Pin** is the pin that controls whether or not the modem itself is powered.  Use -1 if your modem is always receiving power from your logger board or if you want to control modem power independently.
- The **modemStatusPin** is the pin that indicates whether the modem is turned on and it is clear to send data.  If you use -1, the modem is assumed to always be ready.
- The **modemSleepRqPin** is the _pin_ used to put the modem to sleep or to wake it up.
- The **ModemSleepType** controls _how the modemSleepRqPin is used_ to put the modem to sleep between readings.
    - Use _"modem_sleep_held"_ if the SleepRq pin is held HIGH to keep the modem awake, as with a Sodaq GPRSBee rev6.
    - Use _"modem_sleep_pulsed"_ if the SleepRq pin is pulsed high and then low to wake the modem up, as with an Adafruit Fona or Sodaq GPRSBee rev4.
    - Use _"modem_sleep_reverse"_ if the SleepRq pin is held LOW to keep the modem awake, as with all XBees.
    - Use *"modem_always_on"* if you do not want the library to control the modem power and sleep.
- Please see the section "[Notes on Arduino Streams and Software Serial](#SoftwareSerial)" for more information about what streams can be used along with this library.

Once the modem has been set up, it has all the functions of sensor object.  These additional functions are available:

- **connectInternet()** - Connects to the internet via WiFi or cellular network.  Returns true if connection is successful.
- **openTCP(const char host, uint16_t port)** - Makes a TCP connection to a host URL and port.  (The most common port for public URLs is "80"; if you don't know the port, try this first.)  Returns 1 if successful.
- **openTCP(IPAddress ip, uint16_t port)** - Makes a TCP connection to a host ip address and port.  Returns 1 if successful.
- **closeTCP()** - Breaks the TCP connection.
- **disconnectInternet()** - Disconnects from the network, if applicable.
- **off()** - Turns the modem off and empties the send and receive buffer.  Returns true if connection is successful.
- **getNISTTime()** - Returns the current Unix time stamp (_in UTC_) from NIST via the TIME protocol (rfc868).

As mentioned above, the cellular modems themselves are also sensors with the following variables:

```cpp
Modem_RSSI(&modem, "UUID", "customVarCode");  // Received Signal Strength Indication, in dB
Modem_SignalPercent(&modem, "UUID", "customVarCode");
```

The modem does not behave quite the same as all the other sensors do, though.  Setup must be done with the '''setupModem(...)''' function; the normal '''setup()''' function does not do anything.  The '''sleep()''' and '''powerDown()''' functions also do not work, the modem will only go off with the '''off()''' function.

Note for GPRSBee modems: To start the modem you will need to power the logger board off, connect the battery to the logger board, and finally attach the modem to the logger board. Then you may power the board and run your sketch. We have found that attaching a GPRSBee modem to power in a different sequence results in the modem reporting zero signal strength. Note, the Mayfly connected to a computer via USB does not supply sufficient power to the GPRSBee. If the community finds this true for other modems, please let us know.


### <a name="DIYlogger"></a>Additional Functions Available for a LoggerEnviroDIY Object:
These functions attach a modem and set up the required registration token and sampling feature UUID for the EnviroDIY web streaming data loader API.  **All three** functions must be called before calling any of the other EnviroDIYLogger functions.  You *must* also add the correct variable UUID's to the constructors for each variable you are using.  All of the UUID and token values can be obtained after registering at http://data.envirodiy.org/.

- **attachModem(loggerModem &modem)** - Attaches a loggerModem to the logger, which the logger then can use to send data to the internet.  See [Modem and Internet Functions](#Modem) for more information on how the modem must be set up before it is attached to the logger.  You must include an ampersand to tie in the already created modem!
- **setToken(const char \*registrationToken)** - Sets the registration token to access the EnviroDIY streaming data loader API.  Note that the input is a pointer to the registrationToken.
- **setSamplingFeatureUUID(const char \*samplingFeatureUUID)** - Sets the universally unique identifier (UUID or GUID) of the sampling feature.  Note that the input is a pointer to the samplingFeatureUUID.

Because sending data to EnviroDIY depends on having some sort of modem or internet connection, there is a modem object created within the LoggerEnviroDIY Object.  To set up that modem object, you still need to call the functions listed in the LoggerModem section, but you need to add an extra "modem." before the function name to call the internal modem object.  You do not need to separately create the object.

Within the loop, these two functions will then format and send out data:

- **generateSensorDataJSON()** - Generates a properly formatted JSON string to go to the EnviroDIY streaming data loader API.
- **postDataEnviroDIY()** - Creates proper headers and sends data to the EnviroDIY data portal.  Depends on the modem support module.  Returns an HTML response code.

### <a name="LoggerExamples"></a>Logger Examples:

To set up logging, you must first include the appropriate logging module and create a new logger instance.  This must happen outside of the setup and loop functions:

```cpp
// Import Logger Module
#include <LoggerBase.h>
// Create a new logger instance
Logger logger;
```

--OR--

```cpp
// Import Logger Module
#include <LoggerEnviroDIY.h>
// Create a new logger instance
LoggerEnviroDIY EnviroDIYLogger;
```

_Within the setup function_, you must then initialize the logger and then run the logger setup.  For the EnviroDIY logger, you must also set up the communication.  (Please note that these are shown with default values.):

```cpp
// Set the time zone and offset from the RTC
logger.setTimeZone(timeZone);
logger.setTZOffset(offset);
// Initialize the logger
logger.init(SDCardPin, mcuWakePin, variableCount, variableList, loggingIntervalMinutes, loggerID);
// OPTIONAL - specify a pin to give an alert when a measurement is taken
// This should generally be a pin with an LED
setAlertPin(int ledPin);
// Begin the logger;
logger.begin();
```

--OR--

```cpp
// Set the time zone and offset from the RTC
EnviroDIYLogger.setTimeZone(timeZone);
EnviroDIYLogger.setTZOffset(offset);
// Initialize the logger
EnviroDIYLogger.init(SDCardPin, mcuWakePin, variableCount, variableList, loggingIntervalMinutes, loggerID);
// OPTIONAL - specify a pin to give an alert when a measurement is taken
// This should generally be a pin with an LED
setAlertPin(ledPin);
// Set up the communication with EnviroDIY
EnviroDIYLogger.setToken(registrationToken);
EnviroDIYLogger.setSamplingFeature(samplingFeature);
EnviroDIYLogger.setUUIDs(UUIDs[]);

// Set up the logger modem
modem.setupModem(modemStream, vcc33Pin, modemStatusPin, modemSleepRqPin, sleepType, APN);

// Attach the modem to the logger
EnviroDIYLogger.attachModem(&modem);

// Connect to the network
if (modem.connectInternet())
{
    // Synchronize the RTC
    EnviroDIYLogger.syncRTClock();
}
// Disconnect from the network
modem.disconnectInternet();

// Begin the logger;
EnviroDIYLogger.begin();
```

_Within the main loop function_, all logging and sending of data can be done using a single program line.  Because the built-in log functions already handle sleeping and waking the board processor, **there cannot be nothing else within the loop function.**

```cpp
void loop()
{
    logger.log();
}
```

--OR--

```cpp
void loop()
{
    EnviroDIYLogger.log();
}
```
If you would like to do other things within the loop function, you should access the component logging functions individually instead of using the short-cut functions.  In this case, here are some guidelines for writing a loop function:

- If you want to log on an even interval, use ```if (checkInterval())``` or ```if (checkMarkedInterval())``` to verify that the current or marked time is an even interval of the logging interval..
- Call the ```markTime()``` function before printing/sending/saving any data that you want associate with a timestamp.
- Wake up all your sensors with ```sensorsWake()```.
- Update all the sensors in your VariableArray together with ```updateAllSensors()```.
- Immediately after running ```updateAllSensors()```, put sensors to sleep to save power with ```sensorsSleep()```.
- After updating the sensors, then call any functions you want to send/print/save data.
- Finish by putting the logger back to sleep, if desired, with ```systemSleep()```.

The double_logger example program demonstrates using a custom loop function in order to log two different groups of sensors at different logging intervals.


## Available sensors

There are a number of sensors supported by this library.  Depending on the sensor, it may communicate with the Arduino board using as a serial peripheral interface (SPI), inter-integrated curcuit (I2C, also called "Wire"), or some type of universal synchronous/asynchronous receiver/transmitter (USART, almost always simply called "serial") (USART or serial includes transistor-transistor logic (TTL), RS232 (adapter needed), and RS485 (adapter needed) communication).  See the section on [Processor Compatibility](#compatibility) for more specific notes on which pins are available for each type of communication on the various supported processors.

Essentially all of the sensors can have their power supplies turned off between readings, but not all boards are able to switch output power on and off.  When the sensor constructor asks for the Arduino pin controlling power on/off, use -1 for any board which is not capable of switching the output power on and off.

Please, please, when setting up multiple sensors on a logger, be smart about it.  Don't try to connect too many sensors all at once or you're likely to exceed your logger's power regulator or come across strange interferences between them.  _**TEST YOUR LOGGER WITH ALL SENSORS ATTACHED BEFORE DEPLOYING IT TO THE FIELD!**_  Don't even think about skipping the in-lab testing!  Theoretically every single sensor possible could be attached to the same processor, but the reality is that boards have finite numbers of pins, solar panels can only create so much charge, and not all sensors like each other very much.

### <a name="MaxBotix"></a>[MaxBotix MaxSonar](http://www.maxbotix.com/Ultrasonic_Sensors/High_Accuracy_Sensors.htm) - HRXL MaxSonar WR or WRS Series with TTL Outputs

The IP67 rated HRXL-MaxSonar-WR ultrasonic rangefinders offer 1mm resolution, 2.7-5.5VDC operation, a narrow beam pattern, high power output, noise rejection, automatic calibration, and temperature compensation.  Depending on the precise model, the range finders have ranges between 300 and 9999mm and read rates of 6-7.5Hz.  This library supports TTL or RS323 sensor output, though an RS232-to-TTL adapter is needed for the RS232 models.  Analog and pulse-width outputs are not supported.  The MaxBotix sensors require a 2.7V-5.5V power supply to pin 6 on the sensor (which can be turned off between measurements) and the level of the TTL returned by the MaxSonar will match the power level it is supplied with.   The digital TTL or RS232 output is sent out on pin 5 on the sensor.  Pin 7 of the MaxSonar must be connected to power ground and pin 4 can optionally be used to trigger the MaxSonar.

If you are using the [MaxBotix HR-MaxTemp](https://www.maxbotix.com/Ultrasonic_Sensors/MB7955.htm) MB7955 temperature compensator on your MaxBotix (which greatly improves data quality), the red wire from the MaxTemp should be attached to pin 1 on the MaxSonar.  The white and shield wires from the MaxTemp should both be attached to Pin 7 or the MaxSonar (which is also attached to the Arduino ground).  The MaxTemp communicates directly with the MaxSonar and there is no need to make any changes on the Aruduino itself for the MaxTemp.

The MaxBotix sensor have two different modes: free-ranging and triggered.  Unless the trigger pin is externally held low, the sensor will continuously take readings at a rate of 6Hz or greater and immediate report each result over the digital output pin.  (That is, it will be in free-ranging mode.)  When continuously powered and operating in free-range mode, the data output is automatically filtered to help improve accuracy.  If you are turning the power to the sensor off between readings, there is no advantage to using the free-ranging because many readings must be taken before the filter becomes effective.  In this case, you may save some power by setting up a trigger pin and manually trigger individual readings.

The Arduino pin controlling power on/off, a stream instance for received data (ie, ```Serial```), and the Arduino pin controlling the trigger are required for the sensor constructor.  (Use -1 for the trigger pin if you do not have it connected.)  Please see the section "[Notes on Arduino Streams and Software Serial](#SoftwareSerial)" for more information about what streams can be used along with this library.

This library supports using multiple MaxBotix sensors on the same logger, with a few caveats:  
 - Any sensor operating in free-ranging mode (powered at the same time as any other sensors with the trigger pins unconnected) must have a dedicated stream instance/serial port.
 - To have two sensors operating in free-ranging mode, they must each have a dedicated stream instance/serial port *AND* you must specify a unique _negative_ pin number for the trigger pin.  Giving a negative pin number ensures that the Arduino will not attempt to trigger trigger individual readings but will still be able to tell the sensors apart.  (Software-wise, simply specifying the different streams is not enough!)  Keep in mind that two or more free ranging sensors must be spaced far enough apart in the field to prevent interference between the sonar beams.
 - Two or more sensors may send data to the same stream instance/serial port if both sensors are being triggered and each is triggered by a different trigger pin.
 - "Daisy chaining" sensors so the pulse-width output of one sensor acts as the trigger for a second sensor is not supported.

The main constructor for the sensor object is:  (The trigger pin and number of readings to average are optional.)

```cpp
#include <MaxBotixSonar.h>
MaxBotixSonar sonar(sonarStream, SonarPower, SonarTrigger, measurementsToAverage);
```

The single available variable is:  (UUID and customVarCode are optional; UUID must always be listed first.)

```cpp
MaxBotixSonar_Range(&sonar, "UUID", "customVarCode");  // Ultrasonic range in mm
//  Resolution is 1mm
//  Accuracy is ± 1%
//  Range is 300mm 5000mm or 500mm to 9999mm, depending on  model
```

In addition to the constructors for the sensor and variable, you must remember to "begin" your stream instance within the main setup function.  The baud rate must be set to 9600 for all MaxBotix sensors.

```cpp
sonarStream.begin(9600);
```

### <a name="OBS3"></a>[Campbell Scientific OBS-3+](https://www.campbellsci.com/obs-3plus)

The version of the OBS-3+ that this library supports sends out a simple analog signal between 0 and 2.5V.  (The 5V and 4-20mA versions are _not_ supported by this library.)  To convert the analog signal to a high resolution digital signal, the sensor must be attached to a [TI ADS1115](http://www.ti.com/product/ADS1115) 16-bit ADD converter.  (This module is built into the EnviroDIY Mayfly.)  The TI ADS1115 ADD communicates with the main processor via I2C.  In the majority of break-out boards, and on the Mayfly, the I2C address of the ADS1x15 is set as 0x48 by tying the address pin to ground.  Up to four of these ADD's be used by changing the address value by changing the connection of the address pin on the ADS1x15.  The ADS1x15 requires an input voltage of 2.0-5.5V, but this library assumes the ADS is powered with 3.3V.  The OBS-3 itself requires a 5-15V power supply, which can be turned off between measurements.  (It will actually run on power as low as 3.3V.)  The power supply is connected to the red wire, low range output comes from the blue wire, high range output comes from the white wire, and the black, green, and silver/unshielded wires should all be connected to ground.

The Arduino pin controlling power on/off, analog data pin _on the TI ADS1115_, and calibration values _in Volts_ for Ax^2 + Bx + C are required for the sensor constructor.  A custom variable code can be entered as a second argument in the variable constructors, and it is very strongly recommended that you use this otherwise it will be very difficult to determine which return is high and which is low range on the sensor.  If your ADD converter is not at the standard address of 0x48, you can enter its actual address as the third argument.  Do NOT forget that if you want to give a number of measurements to average, that comes _after_ the i2c address in the constructor!

Note that to access both the high and low range returns, two instances must be created, one at the low range return pin and one at the high pin.

The main constructor for the sensor object is (called once each for high and low range):

```cpp
#include <CampbellOBS3.h>
CampbellOBS3 osb3low(OBS3Power, OBSLowPin, OBSLow_x2_coeff_A, OBSLow_x1_coeff_B, OBSLow_x0_coeff_C, ADS1x15_i2cAddress, measurementsToAverage);
CampbellOBS3 osb3high(OBS3Power, OBSHighPin, OBSHigh_x2_coeff_A, OBSHigh_x1_coeff_B, OBSHigh_x0_coeff_C, ADS1x15_i2cAddress, measurementsToAverage);
```

The single available variable is (called once each for high and low range):

```cpp
CampbellOBS3_Turbidity(&osb3low, "UUID", "customLowVarCode");  // Low Range Turbidity in NTU
CampbellOBS3_Turbidity(&osb3high, "UUID", "customHighVarCode");  // High Range Turbidity in NTU
//  Ranges: (depends on sediment size, particle shape, and reflectivity)
//      Turbidity (low/high): 250/1000 NTU; 500/2000 NTU; 1000/4000 NTU
//      Mud: 5000 to 10,000 mg L–1
//      Sand: 50,000 to 100,000 mg L–1
//  Accuracy: (whichever is larger)
//      Turbidity: 2% of reading or 0.5 NTU
//      Mud: 2% of reading or 1 mg L–1
//      Sand: 4% of reading or 10 mg L–1
// Resolution:
//    16-bit ADC
//        Turbidity: 0.004/0.01 NTU; 0.008/0.03 NTU; 0.01/0.06 NTU
//    12-bit ADC
//        Turbidity: 0.06/0.2 NTU; 0.1/0.5 NTU; 0.2/1.0 NTU
```

### <a name="5TM"></a>[Decagon Devices 5TM](https://www.decagon.com/en/soils/volumetric-water-content-sensors/5tm-vwc-temp/) Soil Moisture and Temperature Sensor

Decagon sensors communicate with the board using the [SDI-12 protocol](http://www.sdi-12.org/) (and the [Arduino SDI-12 library](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/Arduino-SDI-12)).  They require a 3.5-12V power supply, which can be turned off between measurements.  While contrary to the manual, they will run with power as low as 3.3V.  On the 5TM with a stereo cable, the power is connected to the tip, data to the ring, and ground to the sleeve.  On the bare-wire version, the power is connected to the _white_ cable, data to _red_, and ground to the unshielded cable.

The SDI-12 address of the sensor, the Arduino pin controlling power on/off, and the Arduino pin sending and receiving data are required for the sensor constructor.  Optionally, you can include a number of distinct readings to average.  The data pin must be a pin that supports pin-change interrupts.  To find or change the SDI-12 address of your sensor, load and run example [b_address_change](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/Arduino-SDI-12/tree/master/examples/b_address_change) within the SDI-12 library.

Keep in mind that SDI12 is a slow communication protocol (only 1200 baud) and _ALL interrupts are turned off during communication_.  This means that if you have any interrupt driven sensors (like a tipping bucket) attached with an SDI12 sensor, no interrupts (or tips) will be registered during SDI12 communication.

The main constructor for the sensor object is:

```cpp
#include <Decagon5TM.h>
Decagon5TM fivetm(TMSDI12address, SDI12Power, SDI12Data, measurementsToAverage);
```

The three available variables are:  (UUID and customVarCode are optional; UUID must always be listed first.)

```cpp
Decagon5TM_Ea(&fivetm, "UUID", "customVarCode");  // Ea/Matric Potential Variable in farads per meter
Decagon5TM_VWC(&fivetm, "UUID", "customVarCode");  // Volumetric water content as percent, calculated from Ea via TOPP equation
//  Resolution is 0.0008 m3/m3 (0.08% VWC) from 0 – 50% VW
//  Accuracy for Generic calibration equation: ± 0.03 m3/m3 (± 3% VWC) typical
//  Accuracy for Medium Specific Calibration: ± 0.02 m3/m3 (± 2% VWC)
//  Range is 0 – 1 m3/m3 (0 – 100% VWC)
Decagon5TM_Temp(&fivetm, "UUID", "customVarCode");  // Temperature in °C
//  Resolution is 0.1°C
//  Accuracy is ± 1°C
//  Range is - 40°C to + 50°C

The main constructor for the sensor object is:

```cpp
#include <DecagonES2.h>

```

### <a name="DS18"></a>[Maxim DS18 Temperature Probes](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/analog/sensors-and-sensor-interface/DS18S20.html)

The Maxim temperature probes communicate using the OneWire library, which can be used on any digital pin on any of the supported boards.  The same module should work with a [DS18B20](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/analog/sensors-and-sensor-interface/DS18B20.html), [DS18S20](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/analog/sensors-and-sensor-interface/DS18S20.html), [DS1822](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/analog/sensors-and-sensor-interface/DS1822.html), [MAX31820](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/analog/sensors-and-sensor-interface/MAX31820.html), and the no-longer-sold [DS1820](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/analog/sensors-and-sensor-interface/DS1820.html) sensor.  These sensors can be attached to a 3.0-5.5V power source or they can take "parasitic power" from the data line.  When using the more typical setup with power, ground, and data lines, a 4.7k resistor must be attached as a pull-up between the data and power lines.  The one-wire communication protocol is slow and _interrupts are turned off during communication_.  Keep this in mind if using this sensor in combination with a rain gauge or other interrupt-driven sensor.

The OneWire hex address of the sensor, the Arduino pin controlling power on/off, and the Arduino pin sending and receiving data are required for the sensor constructor.  The hex address is an array of 8 hex values, for example:  {0x28, 0x1D, 0x39, 0x31, 0x2, 0x0, 0x0, 0xF0}.  To get the address of your sensor, plug a single sensor into your device and run the [oneWireSearch](https://github.com/milesburton/Arduino-Temperature-Control-Library/blob/master/examples/oneWireSearch/oneWireSearch.ino) example or the [Single](https://github.com/milesburton/Arduino-Temperature-Control-Library/blob/master/examples/Single/Single.pde) example provided within the Dallas Temperature library.  The sensor address is programmed at the factory and cannot be changed.

The main constructor for the sensor object is:

```cpp
#include <MaximDS18.h>
MaximDS18 ds18(OneWireAddress, powerPin, dataPin, measurementsToAverage);
```

_If and only if you have exactly one sensor attached on your OneWire pin or bus_, you can use this constructor to save yourself the trouble of finding the address:

```cpp
#include <MaximDS18.h>
MaximDS18 ds18(powerPin, dataPin, measurementsToAverage);
```

The single available variable is:  (UUID and customVarCode are optional; UUID must always be listed first.)

```cpp
MaximDS18_Temp(&ds18, "UUID", "customVarCode");  // Temperature in °C
// Resolution is between 0.0625°C (12 bit) and 0.5°C (9-bit)
// Accuracy is ±0.5°C from -10°C to +85°C for DS18S20 and DS18B20, ±2°C for DS1822 and MAX31820
// Range is -55°C to +125°C (-67°F to +257°F)
```

### <a name="AM2315"></a>[AOSong AM2315](www.aosong.com/asp_bin/Products/en/AM2315.pdf) Encased I2C Temperature/Humidity Sensor

The AOSong AM2315 and [CM2311](http://www.aosong.com/en/products/details.asp?id=193) communicate with the board via I2C.  Because this sensor can have only one I2C address (0xB8), it is only possible to connect one of these sensors to your system.  This sensor should be attached to a 3.3-5.5V power source and the power supply to the sensor can be stopped between measurements.

The only input needed for the sensor constructor is the Arduino pin controlling power on/off and optionally the number of readings to average:

```cpp
#include <AOSongAM2315.h>
AOSongAM2315 am2315(I2CPower, measurementsToAverage);
```

The two available variables are:  (UUID and customVarCode are optional; UUID must always be listed first.)

```cpp
AOSongAM2315_Humidity(&am2315, "UUID", "customVarCode");  // Percent relative humidity
//  Resolution is 0.1 % RH (16 bit)
//  Accuracy is ± 2 % RH
//  Range is 0 - 100 % RH

### <a name="BME280"></a>[Bosch BME280](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/bst/products/all_products/bme280) Integrated Environmental Sensor

Although this sensor has the option of either I2C or SPI communication, this library only supports I2C.  The default I2C address varies by manufacturer and is either 0x77 or 0x76. The Adafruit and Sparkfun defaults are both 0x77 and Seeed/Grove default is 0x76, though all can be changed by physical modification of the sensor, if necessary (by cutting the board connection for the manufacturer default and soldering the optional address jumpers).  To connect two of these sensors to your system, you must ensure they are soldered so as to have different I2C addresses.  No more than two can be attached (unless you use a multiplexer).  This module is likely to also work with the [Bosch BMP280 Barometric Pressure Sensor](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/bst/products/all_products/bmp280), though it has not been tested on it.  These sensors should be attached to a 1.7-3.6V power source and the power supply to the sensor can be stopped between measurements.

The only input needed is the Arduino pin controlling power on/off; the i2cAddressHex is optional as is the number of readings to average:

```cpp
#include <BoschBME280.h>
BoschBME280 bme280(I2CPower, i2cAddressHex, measurementsToAverage);
```

The four available variables are:  (UUID and customVarCode are optional; UUID must always be listed first.)

```cpp

### <a name="DHT"></a>[AOSong DHT](http://www.aosong.com/en/products/index.asp) Digital-Output Relative Humidity & Temperature Sensor

This module will work with an AOSong [DHT11/CHT11](http://www.aosong.com/en/products/details.asp?id=109), DHT21/AM2301, and [DHT22/AM2302/CM2302](http://www.aosong.com/en/products/details.asp?id=117).  These sensors use a single-bus single wire digital signaling protocol.  They can be connected to any digital pin.  Please keep in mind that, per manufacturer instructions, these sensors should not be polled more frequently than once every 2 seconds.  These sensors should be attached to a 3.3-6V power source and the power supply to the sensor can be stopped between measurements.  The communication with these sensors is slow and _interrupts are turned off during communication_.  (See the Adafruit DHT library's DHT.cpp for details.)  Keep this in mind if using this sensor in combination with a rain gauge or other interrupt-driven sensor.  Also note that the temperature sensor built into the AOSong DHT is a Maxim DS18 sensor.

The Arduino pin controlling power on/off, the Arduino pin receiving data, and the sensor type are required for the sensor constructor.  The number of readings to average is optional:

```cpp
#include <AOSongDHT.h>
AOSongDHT dht(DHTPower, DHTPin, dhtType, measurementsToAverage);
```

The three available variables are:  (UUID and customVarCode are optional; UUID must always be listed first.)

```cpp
AOSongDHT_Humidity(&dht, "UUID", "customVarCode");  // Percent relative humidity
//  Resolution is 0.1 % RH for DHT22 and 1 % RH for DHT11

### <a name="SQ212"></a>[Apogee SQ-212 Quantum Light Sensor](https://www.apogeeinstruments.com/sq-212-amplified-0-2-5-volt-sun-calibration-quantum-sensor/) Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR)
This library will work with the Apogee SQ-212 and SQ-212 analog quantum light sensors, and could be readily adapted to work with similar sensors (e.g. SQ-215 or SQ225) with by simply changing the calibration factors.  These sensors send out a simple analog signal.  To convert that to a high resolution digital signal, the sensor must be attached to a TI ADS1115 ADD converter.  The TI ADS1115 ADD communicates with the main processor via I2C.  In the majority of break-out boards, and on the Mayfly, the I2C address of the ADS1x15 is set as 0x48 by tying the address pin to ground.  Up to four of these ADD's be used by changing the address value by changing the connection of the address pin on the ADS1x15.  The ADS1x15 requires an input voltage of 2.0-5.5V, but this library assumes the ADS is powered with 3.3V.  The PAR sensors should be attached to a 5-24V power source and the power supply to the sensor can be stopped between measurements.

The Arduino pin controlling power on/off and the analog data pin _on the TI ADS1115_ are required for the sensor constructor.  If your ADD converter is not at the standard address of 0x48, you can enter its actual address as the third argument.

```cpp
#include <ApogeeSQ212.h>
ApogeeSQ212 SQ212(SQ212Power, SQ212Data, ADS1x15_i2cAddress, measurementsToAverage);
```

The one available variable is:  (UUID and customVarCode are optional; UUID must always be listed first.)

```cpp

### <a name="Yosemitech"></a>[Yosemitech Brand Environmental Sensors ](http://www.yosemitech.com/en/)

This library currently supports the following Yosemitech sensors:

- [Y502-A or Y504-A Optical Dissolved Oxygen Sensors](http://www.yosemitech.com/en/product-10.html)
- [Y510-B Optical Turbidity Sensor](http://www.yosemitech.com/en/product-17.html)
- [Y511-A Optical Turbidity Sensor with Wiper](http://www.yosemitech.com/en/product-16.html)
- [Y514-A Chlorophyll Sensor with Wiper](http://www.yosemitech.com/en/product-14.html)
- [Y520-A 4-Electrode Conductivity Sensor](http://www.yosemitech.com/en/product-18.html)
- Y532-A Digital pH Sensor
- Y533 ORP Sensor
- [Y550-B UV254/COD Sensor with Wiper](http://www.yosemitech.com/en/product-21.html)
- [Y4000 Multiparameter Sonde](http://www.yosemitech.com/en/product-20.html)

All of these sensors require a 5-12V power supply and the power supply can be stopped between measurements.  (_Note that any user settings (such as brushing frequency) will be lost if the sensor loses power._)  They communicate via [Modbus RTU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modbus) over [RS-485](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-485).  To interface with them, you will need an RS485-to-TTL adapter.  The white wire of the Yosemitech sensor will connect to the "B" pin of the adapter and the green wire will connect to "A".  The red wire from the sensor should connect to the 5-12V power supply and the black to ground.  The Vcc pin on the adapter should be connected to another power supply (voltage depends on the specific adapter) and the ground to the same ground.  The red wire from the sensor _does not_ connect to the Vcc of the adapter.  The R/RO/RXD pin from the adapter connects to the TXD on the Arduino board and the D/DI/TXD pin from the adapter connects to the RXD.  If applicable, tie the RE and DE (receive/data enable) pins together and connect them to another pin on your board.  While this library supports an external enable pin, we have had very bad luck with most of them.  Adapters with automatic direction control tend to use very slightly more power, but have more stable communication.  There are a number of RS485-to-TTL adapters available.  When shopping for one, be mindful of the logic level of the TTL output by the adapter.  The MAX485, one of the most popular adapters, has a 5V logic level in the TTL signal.  This will _fry_ any board like the Mayfly that can only use on 3.3V logic.  You would need a voltage shifter in between the Mayfly and the MAX485 to make it work.

The sensor modbus address, the pin controlling sensor power, a stream instance for data (ie, ```Serial```), the Arduino pin controlling the receive and data enable on your RS485-to-TTL adapter, and the number of readings to average are required for the sensor constructor.  (Use -1 for the enable pin if your adapter does not have one.)  For all of these sensors except pH, Yosemitech strongly recommends averaging 10 readings for each measurement.  Please see the section "[Notes on Arduino Streams and Software Serial](#SoftwareSerial)" for more information about what streams can be used along with this library.  In tests on these sensors, SoftwareSerial_ExtInts _did not work_ to communicate with these sensors, because it isn't stable enough.  AltSoftSerial and HardwareSerial work fine.

By default, this library cuts power to the sensors between readings, causing them to lose track of their brushing interval.  The library manually activates the brushes as part of the "wake" command.  There are currently no other ways to set the brushing interval in this library.

The various sensor and variable constructors are:  (UUID and customVarCode are optional; UUID must always be listed first.)

### <a name="dOpto"></a>[Zebra-Tech D-Opto](http://www.zebra-tech.co.nz/d-opto-sensor/) Dissolved Oxygen Sensor

The Zebra-Tech D-Opto sensor communicates with the board using the [SDI-12 protocol](http://www.sdi-12.org/) (and the [Arduino SDI-12 library](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/Arduino-SDI-12)).  It require an 8-12V power supply, which can be turned off between measurements.  The connection between the logger and the Arduino board is made by way of a white interface module provided by Zebra-Tech. You will need a voltage booster or a separate power supply to give the D-Opto sufficient voltage to run.  We use [Pololu 9V Step-Up Voltage Regulators](https://www.pololu.com/product/2116).

The SDI-12 address of the sensor, the Arduino pin controlling power on/off, and the Arduino pin sending and receiving data are required for the sensor constructor.  Optionally, you can include a number of distinct readings to average.  The data pin must be a pin that supports pin-change interrupts.  To find or change the SDI-12 address of your sensor, load and run example [b_address_change](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/Arduino-SDI-12/tree/master/examples/b_address_change) within the SDI-12 library.

Keep in mind that SDI12 is a slow communication protocol (only 1200 baud) and _ALL interrupts are turned off during communication_.  This means that if you have any interrupt driven sensors (like a tipping bucket) attached with an SDI12 sensor, no interrupts (or tips) will be registered during SDI12 communication.

The main constructor for the sensor object is:

```cpp
#include <ZebraTechDOpto.h>
ZebraTechDOpto dopto(*DOptoDI12address, SDI12Power, SDI12Data, measurementsToAverage);
```

The three available variables are:  (UUID and customVarCode are optional; UUID must always be listed first.)

```cpp
ZebraTechDOpto_Temp(&ctd, "UUID", "customVarCode");  // Temperature in °C
//  Resolution is 0.01°C
//  Accuracy is ± 0.1°C
ZebraTechDOpto_DOpct(&ctd, "UUID", "customVarCode");  // Dissolved oxygen percent saturation

### <a name="ExtVolt"></a>External Voltage, via [TI ADS1115](http://www.ti.com/product/ADS1115)
The TI ADS1115 ADD is a high resolution ADS that communicates with the board via I2C.  In the majority of break-out boards, and on the Mayfly, the I2C address of the ADS1x15 is set as 0x48 by tying the address pin to ground.  Up to four of these ADD's be used by changing the address value by changing the connection of the address pin on the ADS1x15.  The ADS1x15 requires an input voltage of 2.0-5.5V, but this library assumes the ADS is powered with 3.3V.  For measuring raw external voltages, this library also allows you to give a gain factor/multiplier to account for use of a voltage divider, such as the [Seeed Grove Voltage Divider](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Voltage_Divider/).

The Arduino pin controlling power on/off and the analog data pin _on the TI ADS1115_ are required for the sensor constructor.  If using a voltage divider to increase the measurable voltage range, enter the gain multiplier as the third argument.  If your ADD converter is not at the standard address of 0x48, you can enter its actual address as the fourth argument.  The number of measurements to average, if more than one is desired, goes as the fifth argument.

```cpp
#include <ExternalVoltage.h>
ExternalVoltage extvolt(VoltPower, VoltData, VoltGain, ADS1x15_i2cAddress, measurementsToAverage);
```

The one available variable is:  (UUID and customVarCode are optional; UUID must always be listed first.)

```cpp
ExternalVoltage_Volt(&extvolt, "UUID", "customVarCode");  // raw voltage in volts
// Range:
//   without voltage divider:  0 - 3.6V
//   1/gain = 3x: 0.3 ~ 12.9v
//   1/gain = 10x: 1 ~ 43v
// Accuracy is < ± 1%
// Resolution: 16-bit ADC:
//   without voltage divider:  0.05mV
//   1/gain = 3x: 0.2mV
//   1/gain = 10x: 0.65 mV

### <a name="ExtTips"></a>[External I2C Rain Tipping Bucket Counter](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/TippingBucketRainGauge)
This module is for use with a simple external I2C tipping bucket counter.  This is *NOT* for direct counting of tips using an interrupt on the main processor.  The construction and programming of the tipping bucket counter is documented in the GitHub link above.  It is assumed that the processor of the tip counter takes care of its own power management.

All constructor arguments are optional, but the first argument is for the I2C address of the tip counter (if not 0x08) and the second is for the depth of rain (in mm) per tip event (if not 0.2mm).  Most metric tipping buckets are calibrated to have 1 tip per 0.2mm of rain.  Most English tipping buckets are calibrated to have 1 tip per 0.01" of rain, which is 0.254mm.  Note that you cannot input a number of measurements to average because averaging does not make sense with this kind of counted variable.

```cpp
#include <RainCounterI2C.h>
RainCounterI2C tip(RainCounterI2CAddress, depthPerTipEvent);
```

The two available variables are:  (UUID and customVarCode are optional; UUID must always be listed first.)

```cpp
RainCounterI2C_Tips(&tip, "UUID", "customVarCode");  // raw count of tips
RainCounterI2C_Depth(&tip, "UUID", "customVarCode");  // rain depth in mm
// Range, accuracy, and resolution depend on the actual tipping bucket module

### <a name="MS5803"></a>[Measurement Specialties MS5803](http://www.te.com/usa-en/product-CAT-BLPS0013.html) Digital Pressure Sensor

These sensors come in several different pressure ranges.  The maximum measurable pressure is assumed to be 14bar (the most common model), but this can be changed in the constructor.  Although this sensor has the option of either I2C or SPI communication, this library only supports I2C.  _The I2C sensor address is assumed to be 0x76_, though it can be changed to 0x77 in the constructor if necessary.  The sensor address is determined by how the sensor is soldered onto its breakout board.  To connect two of these sensors to your system, you must ensure they are soldered so as to have different I2C addresses.  No more than two can be attached.  These sensors should be attached to a 1.7-3.6V power source and the power supply to the sensor can be stopped between measurements.  NOTE:  These I2C addresses are the same as those available for the Bosch BME280 Barometric Pressure Sensor!  If you are also using one of those sensors, make sure that the address for that sensor does not conflict with the address of this sensor.  

The only input needed is the Arduino pin controlling power on/off; the i2cAddressHex and maximum pressure are optional as is the number of readings to average:

```cpp
#include <MeaSpecMS5803.h>
MeaSpecMS5803 ms5803(I2CPower, i2cAddressHex, maxPressure, measurementsToAverage);
```

The two available variables are:  (UUID and customVarCode are optional; UUID must always be listed first.)

```cpp
MeaSpecMS5803_Pressure(&ms5803, "UUID", "customVarCode");  // pressure in millibar
// For Pressure (sensor designed for water pressure):
//   Resolution is 1 / 0.6 / 0.4 / 0.3 / 0.2 mbar (where 1 mbar = 100 pascals)
//      at oversampling ratios: 256 / 512 / 1024 / 2048 / 4096, respectively.
//   Accuracy 0 to +40°C is ±20mbar
//   Accuracy -40°C to +85°C is ±40mbar
//   Range is 0 to 14 bar
//   Long term stability is -20 mbar/yr
MeaSpecMS5803_Temp(&ms5803, "UUID", "customVarCode");  // temperature in °C
// For Temperature:
//   Resolution is <0.01°C
//   Accuracy is ±0.8°C

### <a name="keller"></a>[Keller Submersible Water Level Transmitters](http://www.te.com/usa-en/product-CAT-BLPS0013.html) Pressure Sensor

Many Keller pressure and water level sensors can communicate via Modbus RTU over RS485. The functions below should work with any Keller Series 30, Class 5, Group 20 sensor (such as the Keller Acculevel) that are Software version 5.20-12.28 and later (i.e. made after the 2012 in the 28th week). Note that these have only been tested with the Acculevel. More documentation for our implementation of the Keller Modbus communication Protocol commands and responses, along with information about the various variables, can be found in the [EnviroDIY KellerModbus library](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/KellerModbus). Sensors ship with default Slave addresses set to 0x01, but these can be reset. These Keller sensors expect an input voltage of 9-28 VDC, so they also require a voltage booster and an RS485 to TTL Serial converter with logic level shifting from the higher output voltage to the 3.3V or 5V of the Arduino data logging board.
Digital communication with Keller sensors configured for SDI12 communication protocols are not supported by these functions.

The sensor constructor requires as input: modbus address, the pin controlling sensor power, a stream instance for data (ie, ```Serial```), the Arduino pin controlling the receive and data enable on your RS485-to-TTL adapter, and the number of readings to average.  (Use -1 for the enable pin if your adapter does not have one.) Please see the section "[Notes on Arduino Streams and Software Serial](#SoftwareSerial)" for more information about what streams can be used along with this library.  In tests on these sensors, SoftwareSerial_ExtInts _did not work_ to communicate with these sensors, because it isn't stable enough.  AltSoftSerial and HardwareSerial work fine.

```cpp
#include <KellerAcculevel.h>
KellerAcculevel acculevel(acculevelModbusAddress, modbusSerial, modbusPower, max485EnablePin, acculevelNumberReadings);
```

The two available variables are:  (UUID and customVarCode are optional; UUID must always be listed first.)

```cpp
new KellerAcculevel_Pressure(&acculevel, "UUID", "customVarCode");
new KellerAcculevel_Temp(&acculevel, "UUID", "customVarCode");
new KellerAcculevel_Height(&acculevel, "UUID", "customVarCode");

_____### <a name="MPL115A2"></a>[Freescale Semiconductor MPL115A2](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/MPL115A2.pdf) Miniature I2C Digital Barometer

The MPL115A2 communicates with the board via I2C.  Because this sensor can have only one I2C address (0x60), it is only possible to connect one of these sensors to your system.  This sensor should be attached to a 2.375-5.5V power source and the power supply to the sensor can be stopped between measurements.

The only input needed for the sensor constructor is the Arduino pin controlling power on/off and optionally the number of readings to average:

```cpp
#include <FreescaleMPL115A2.h>
MPL115A2 mpl115a2(I2CPower, measurementsToAverage);
```

The two available variables are:  (UUID and customVarCode are optional; UUID must always be listed first.)

```cpp
MPL115A2_Pressure(&mpl115a2, "UUID", "customVarCode");  // Baraometric pressure in kPa
//  Resolution is 0.15 kPa
//  Accuracy is ±1 kPa
//  Range is 50 to 115 kPa

### <a name="DS3231"></a>Maxim DS3231 Real Time Clock

As the I2C [Maxim DS3231](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/digital/real-time-clocks/DS3231.html) real time clock (RTC) is absolutely required for time-keeping on all AVR boards, this library also makes use of it for its on-board temperature sensor.  The DS3231 requires a 3.3V power supply.

The only argument for the constructor is the number of readings to average, as the RTC requires constant power and is connected via I2C:

```cpp
#include <OnboardSensors.h>
MaximDS3231 ds3231(measurementsToAverage);
```

The only available variables is:  (UUID and customVarCode are optional; UUID must always be listed first.)

```cpp
MaximDS3231_Temp(&ds3231, "UUID", "customVarCode");  // Temperature in °C
//  Resolution is 0.25°C
//  Accuracy is ±3°C
//  Range is 0°C to +70°C

### <a name="Onboard"></a> Processor On-Board Sensors and MetaData

The processor can return the amount of RAM it has available and, for some boards, the battery voltage (EnviroDIY Mayfly, Sodaq Mbili, Ndogo, Autonomo, and One, Adafruit Feathers).  The version of the board is required as input (ie, for a EnviroDIY Mayfly: "v0.3" or "v0.4" or "v0.5").  Use a blank value (ie, "") for un-versioned boards.

The main constructor for the sensor object is:

```cpp
#include <OnboardSensors.h>
ProcessorStats mayfly(MFVersion, measurementsToAverage);
```

The two available variables are:  (UUID and customVarCode are optional; UUID must always be listed first.)

```cpp
ProcessorStats_Batt(&mayfly, "UUID", "customVarCode");  // Current battery voltage in volts
//  Resolution is 0.005V (10 bit ADC)
//  Range is 0 to 5 V
ProcessorStats_FreeRam(&mayfly, "UUID", "customVarCode");  // Amount of free RAM in bits
//  Resolution is 1 bit
//  Accuracy is 1 bit
//  Range is 0 to full RAM available on processor

## <a name="SoftwareSerial"></a>Notes on Arduino Streams and Software Serial

In this library, the Arduino communicates with the computer for debugging, the modem for sending data, and some sensors (like the [MaxBotix MaxSonar](#MaxBotix)) via instances of Arduino TTL "[streams](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Stream)."  The streams can either be an instance of [serial](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Serial) (aka hardware serial), [AltSoftSerial](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/AltSoftSerial), [the EnviroDIY modified version of SoftwareSerial](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/SoftwaterSerial_ExternalInts), or any other stream type you desire.  The very commonly used build-in version of the software serial library for AVR processors uses interrupts that conflict with several other sub-libraries or this library and _cannot be used_!  I repeat:  **_You cannot use the built-in version of SoftwareSerial!_**  You simply cannot.  It will not work.  Period.  This is not a bug that will be fixed.

For stream communication, **hardware serial** should always be your first choice, if your processor has enough hardware serial ports.  Hardware serial ports are the most stable and have the best performance of any of the other streams.  Hardware serial ports are also the only option if you need to communicate with any device that uses even or odd parity, more than one stop bit, or does not use 8 data bits.  (That is, hardware serial ports are the only way to communicate with a device that doesn't use the 8N1 configuration.)  Again, _always use a hardware serial port for communication if possible!_

If the [proper pins](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_AltSoftSerial.html) are available, **[AltSoftSerial](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/AltSoftSerial)** by Paul Stoffregen is also superior to SoftwareSerial, especially at slow baud rates.  Neither hardware serial nor AltSoftSerial require any modifications.  Because of the limited number of serial ports available on most boards, I suggest giving first priority (i.e. the first (or only) hardware serial port, "Serial") to your debugging stream going to your PC (if you intend to debug), second priority to the stream for the modem, and third priority to any sensors that require a stream for communication.  See the section on [Processor Compatibility](#compatibility) for more specific notes on what serial ports are available on the various supported processors.

Another possible serial port emulator is [NeoSWSerial](https://github.com/SlashDevin/NeoSWSerial).  While not as stable as AltSoftSerial, it supports using any pin with pin change interrupts for communication. To use NeoSWSerial, you must open the NeoSWSerial.h file and find and uncomment the line ```//#define NEOSWSERIAL_EXTERNAL_PCINT```.  There are instructions in the ReadMe for the library on how to use EnableInterrupt to activate NeoSWSerial.  Note that NeoSWSerial is incompatible with any version of SDI-12 communication on most 8MHz processors (including the EnviroDIY Mayfly).  The two libraries can be compiled together, but because they are in competition for a timer, they cannot be used together.

To use a hardware serial stream, you do not need to include any libraries or write any extra lines.  You can simply write in "Serial#" where ever you need a stream.  If you would like to give your hardware serial port an easy-to-remember alias, you can use code like this:

```cpp
HardwareSerial* streamName = &Serial;
```

To use AltSoftSerial:

```cpp
#include <AltSoftSerial.h>  // include the AltSoftSerial library
AltSoftSerial streamName;  // Create an instance of AltSoftSerial
```

To use the EnviroDIY modified version of SoftwareSerial:

```cpp
#include <SoftwareSerial_ExtInts.h>  // include the SoftwareSerial library
SoftwareSerial_ExtInts streamName(tx_pin, rx_pin);
```

After creating the stream instances, you must always remember to "begin" your stream within the main setup function.

```cpp
streamName.begin(BAUD_RATE);
```

Additionally, for the EnviroDIY modified version of SoftwareSerial, (or NeoSWSerial) you must enable the interrupts in your setup function:

```cpp
//  Allow enableInterrrupt to control the interrupts for software serial
enableInterrupt(rx_pin, SoftwareSerial_ExtInts::handle_interrupt, CHANGE);
```

Here are some helpful links for more information about the number of serial ports available on some of the different Arduino-style boards:

- For Arduino brand boards:  [https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Serial](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Serial)
- For AtSAMD21 boards:  [https://learn.adafruit.com/using-atsamd21-sercom-to-add-more-spi-i2c-serial-ports/overview](https://learn.adafruit.com/using-atsamd21-sercom-to-add-more-spi-i2c-serial-ports/overview)

## <a name="compatibility"></a>Processor/Board Compatibility

#### AtMega1284p ([EnviroDIY Mayfly](https://envirodiy.org/mayfly/), Sodaq Mbili, Mighty 1284)
The Mayfly _is_ the test board for this library.  _Everything_ is designed to work with this processor.

- An external DS3231 or DS3232 RTC is required.
- There is a single SPI port on pins 14 (MISO), 15 (SCK), and 13 (MOSI) on a Mayfly/Mbili or pins 6 (MISO), 7 (SCK), and 5 (MOSI) on a Mighty 1284 or other AtMega1284p.  Chip select/slave select is pin 12 on a Mayfly and card detect can be set to pin 18 with solder jumper 10.  CS/SS and CD pins may vary for other boards.
- There is a single I2C (Wire) interface on pins 17 (SDA) and 16 (SCL).
- This processor has two built-in hardware serial ports, Serial and Serial1
    - On most boards, Serial is connected to the FDTI chip for USB communication with the computer.  On both the Mayfly and the Mbili Serial1 is wired to the "Bee" sockets for communication with the modem.
- AltSoftSerial can be used on pins 5 (Tx) and 6 (Rx) on the Mayfly or Mbili.  Pin 4 cannot be used while using AltSoftSerial on the Mayfly or Mbili.
    - Unfortunately, the Rx and Tx pins are on different Grove plugs on both the Mayfly and the Mbili making AltSoftSerial somewhat inconvienent to use.
- AltSoftSerial can be used on pins 13 (Tx) and 14 (Rx) on the Mighty 1284 and other 1284p boards.  Pin 12 cannot be used while using AltSoftSerial on the Mighty 1284.
- Any digital pin can be used with SoftwareSerial_ExtInts or SDI-12.
___

#### AtSAMD21 (Arduino Zero, Adafruit Feather M0, Sodaq Autonomo)
Fully supported

- This processor has an internal real time clock (RTC) and does not require a DS3231 to be installed.  The built-in RTC is not as accurate as the DS3231, however, and should be synchronized more frequently to keep the time correct.  The processor clock will also reset if the system battery dies because unlike most external RTC's, there is no coin battery backing up the clock.  At this time, the AtSAMD21 is only supported using the internal clock, but support with a more accurate external RTC is planned.
- This processor has one hardware serial port, USBSerial, which can _only_ be used for USB communication with a computer
- Most variants have 2 other hardware serial ports (Serial on pins 30 (TX) and 31 (RX) and Serial1 on pins 0 (TX) and 1 (RX)) configured by default.
    - On an Arduino Zero Serial goes to the debug port.
    - On a Sodaq Autonomo Serial1 goes to the "Bee" port.
    - On an Adafruit Feather M0 only Serial1 is configured.
- Most variants have one SPI port configured by default (likely pins 22 (MISO), 23 (MOSI), and 24 (SCK)).  Chip select/slave select and card detect pins vary by board.
- Most variants have one I2C (Wire) interface configured by default (likely pins 20 (SDA) and 21 (SCL)).
- There are up to _6_ total "sercom" ports hard which can be configured for either hardware serial, SPI, or I2C (wire) communication on this processor.  See https://learn.adafruit.com/using-atsamd21-sercom-to-add-more-spi-i2c-serial-ports/overview for more instructions on how to configure these ports, if you need them.
- AltSoftSerial is not directly supported on the AtSAMD21, but with some effort, the timers could be configured to make it work.
- SoftwareSerial_ExtInts is not supported at all on the AtSAMD21.
- Any digital pin can be used with SDI-12.
- Because the USB controller is built into the processor, your USB serial connection will close as soon as the processor goes to sleep.  If you need to debug, I recommend using a serial port monitor like [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en) which will automatically renew its connection with the serial port when it connects and disconnects.  Otherwise, you will have to rely on lights on your alert pin or your modem to verify the processor is waking/sleeping properly.
- There is a completely weird bug that causes the code to crash if using input pin 1 on the TI ADS1115 (used for the Campbell OBS3+, Apogee SQ212, and raw external voltages).  I have no idea at all why this happens.  Pins 0, 2, and 3 all work fine.  Just don't use pin 1.

#### AtMega2560 (Arduino Mega)
Should be fully functional, but untested.

- An external DS3231 or DS3232 RTC is required.

- There is a single I2C (Wire) interface on pins 20 (SDA) and 21 (SCL).
- This processor has 4 built-in hardware serial ports Serial, which is connected to the FTDI chip for USB communication with the computer, Serial1 on pins 19 (RX) and 18 (TX), Serial2 on pins 17 (RX) and 16 (TX), and Serial3 on pins 15 (RX) and 14 (TX).
- If you still need more serial ports, AltSoftSerial can be used on pins 46 (Tx) and 48 (Rx).  Pins 44 and 45 cannot be used while using AltSoftSerial on the AtMega2560.
- Pins 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 50, 51, 52, 53, A8 (62), A9 (63), A10 (64), A11 (65), A12 (66), A13 (67), A14 (68), and A15 (69) can be used with SoftwareSerial_ExtInts or SDI-12.

- There is a singe SPI ports on pins 12 (MISO), 13 (SCK), and 11 (MOSI).  Chip select/slave select is pin 10 on an Uno.  SS/CS and CD pins may vary for other boards.
- There is a single I2C (Wire) interface on pins A4 (SDA) and A5 (SCL).
- This processor only has a single hardware serial port, Serial, which is connected to the FTDI chip for USB communication with the computer.
- AltSoftSerial can be used on pins 9 (Tx) and 8 (Rx).  Pin 10 cannot be used while using AltSoftSerial on the AtMega328p.

- Only pins 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, and 16 can be used with SoftwareSerial_ExtInts or SDI-12.  (And pins 14, 15, and 16 will be eliminated if you are using any SPI devices (like an SD card).)
- Because the USB controller is built into the processor, your USB serial connection will close as soon as the processor goes to sleep.  If you need to debug, I recommend using a serial port monitor like Tera Term which will automatically renew its connection with the serial port when it connects and disconnects.  Otherwise, you will have to rely on lights on your alert pin or your modem to verify the processor is waking/sleeping properly.
