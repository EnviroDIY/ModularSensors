# ModularSensors

A "library" of sensors to give all sensors a common interface of functions.  This library was written primarily for the [EnviroDIY Mayfly](https://envirodiy.org/mayfly/) but should be applicable to other Arduino based boards as well.  To use the full functionality of this library, you do need an AVR board with a "large" amount of RAM (in Arduino terms).  The processor on an Arduino UNO or similar board is unlikely to be able to handle all of the logger functionality, though it will be able to access individual sensors.  An Arduino Mega, Sodaq Mbili, or other similar boards should be able to use the full library.  To date, however, the EnviroyDIY Mayfly is the only board that has been tested.

Each sensor is implemented as a subclass of the "SensorBase" class.  Within each sensor, there are subclasses for each variable that the sensor can return.  The sensors can return variables as floats or as a string with the proper number of significant figures for the instrument resolution.

To use a sensor in your sketch, you must include SensorBase.h in your script AND separately include xxx.h for each sensor you intend to use.  While this may force you to write many more include statements, it makes the library lighter weight by not requiring you to install the functions and dependencies for every sensor when only one is needed.

## <a name="Basic"></a>Basic Senor and Variable Functions

### Functions Available for Each Sensor
- **setup()** - This "sets up" the sensor - setting up serial ports, etc required for the given sensor.  This must always be called for each sensor within the "setup" loop of your Arduino program.
- **getStatus()** - This returns the current status of the sensor, if the sensor has some way of giving it to you.  (Most do not.)
- **sleep()** - This puts the sensor to sleep, often by stopping the power.  Returns true.
- **wake()** - This wakes the sensor up and sends it power.  Returns true.
- **getSensorName()** - This gets the name of the sensor and returns it as a string.
- **getSensorLocation()** - This returns the data pin or other sensor installation information as a string.  This is the location where the sensor is connected to the data logger, NOT the position of the sensor in the environment.
- **update()** - This updates the sensor values and returns true when finished.  For digital sensors with a single infomation return, this only needs to be called once for each sensor, even if there are multiple variable subclasses for the sensor.

### Functions for Each Variable Returned by a Sensor
- **getVarName()** - This returns the variable's name using http://vocabulary.odm2.org/variablename/ as a string
- **getVarUnit()** - This returns the variable's unit using http://vocabulary.odm2.org/units/ as a string
- **getValue()** - This returns the current value of the variable as a float.  You should call the update function before calling getValue.  As a backup, if the getValue function sees that the update function has not been called within the last 60 seconds, it will re-call it.
- **getValueString()** - This is identical to getValue, except that it returns a string with the proper precision available from the sensor.

### <a name="individuals"></a>Examples Using Individual Sensor and Variable Functions
To access and get values from a sensor, you must create an instance of the variable subclass you are interested in.  Each variable has different parameters that you must specify when creating the variable instance.  You must create a new instance for each _variable_, not just each sensor.  When using multple variables from the same sensor, you can save time by only calling the setup() and update() functions on a single variable and then calling the getValue() function on all of the variables.  A very simple program which creates instances of the variables and get data from all the parameters measured by a Decagon CTD you might be something like:

```cpp
cond DecagonCTD_Cond(char SDI12address, int powerPin, int dataPin, int numReadings = 1);
temp DecagonCTD_Temp(char SDI12address, int powerPin, int dataPin, int numReadings = 1);
depth DecagonCTD_Depth(char SDI12address, int powerPin, int dataPin, int numReadings = 1);

setup()
{
    cond.setup();
}

loop()
{
    cond.update();
    Serial.println(cond.getValue());
    Serial.println(temp.getValue());
    Serial.println(depth.getValue());
    delay(60000);
}
```


## <a name="Grouped"></a>Grouped Sensor Functions
Having a unified set of functions to access many sensors allows us to quickly poll through a list of sensors to get all results quickly.  Within sensor base, there is a class "SensorArray" that adds functions to use on an array of pointers to sensor objects.

### Functions Available for a SensorArray Object:

- **setupSensors()** - This sets up all of the sensors in the list by running each sensor object's setup() function.  If a sensor doesn't respond to its setup command, the command is called 5 times in attempt to make a connection.  To save time, if two variables from the same sensor are in sequence in the pointer array, the setup function will only be called for the first variable in the sequence.  If all sensors are set up sucessfully, returns true.
- **sensorsSleep()** - This puts all sensors to sleep (ie, cuts power).  Returns true.
- **sensorsWake()** - This wakes all sensors (ie, gives power).  Returns true.
- **updateAllSensors()** - This updates all sensor values.  To save time, if two variables from the same sensor are in sequence in the pointer array, the update function will only be called for the first variable in the sequence.  Returns true.
- **printSensorData(Stream stream)** - This prints curent sensor values along with metadata to a stream.  By default, it will print to the first Serial port.  Note that the input is a pointer to a stream instance.
- **generateSensorDataCSV()** - This returns an Arduino String containing comma separated list of sensor values.  This string does _NOT_ contain a timestamp of any kind.

### <a name="ArrayExamples"></a>SensorArray Examples:

To use the SensorArray module, you must first create the array of pointers.  This must be done outside of the setup() or loop() functions.  Remember that you must create a new instance for each _variable_, not just each sensor.  You should order your list so all the variables from a single sensor come one after the other.  All functions will be called on the sensors in the order they appear in the list.

```cpp
SensorBase *SENSOR_LIST[] = {
    new Sensor1_Variable1(param1, param2, ..., paramX),
    new Sensor1_Variable2(param1, param2, ..., paramX),
    new Sensor2_Variable1(param1, param2, ..., paramX),
    ...
    new SensorX_VariableX(param1, param2, ..., paramX)
};
int sensorCount = sizeof(SENSOR_LIST) / sizeof(SENSOR_LIST[0]);
```

Once you have created the array of pointers, you can initialize the SensorArray module and setup all of the sensors at once in the setup function:

```cpp
// Initialize the sensor array;
sensors.init(sensorCount, SENSOR_LIST);
// Set up all the sensors
sensors.setupSensors();
```

You can then get values or variable names for all of the sensors within the loop with calls like:

```cpp
// Update the sensor value(s)
sensors.updateAllSensors();
// Print the data to the screen
sensors.printSensorData();
```


## <a name="Logger"></a>Logger Functions
Our main reason to unify the output from many sensors is to easily log the data to an SD card and to send it to the EnviroDIY data page.  There are two modules available to use with the sensors to log data:  LoggerBase and LoggerEnviroDIY.  Both of these are sub-classes of SensorArray and contain all of the functions available to a SenorArray as described above.  These both will add the abilities to communicate with a DS3231 real time clock and set up the Arduino as a logger which goes to deep sleep between readings to conserver power.  LoggerBase only adds the functionality to write the data from the sensors to a csv file on a connected SD card.  LoggerEnviroDIY adds the ability to send data to the EnviroDIY data portal.  Both logger modules depend on the [Sodaq](https://github.com/SodaqMoja/Sodaq_DS3231) or [EnviroDIY DS-3231](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/Sodaq_DS3231) (for clock control), the [Sodaq RTCTimer library](https://github.com/SodaqMoja/RTCTimer) (for timing functions), the [EnviroDIY modified version of Sodaq's pin change interrupt library](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/PcInt_PCINT0) (for waking the processor from clock alarms), the AVR sleep library (for low power sleeping), and the [SdFat library](https://github.com/greiman/SdFat) for communicating with the SD card.  The LoggerEnviroDIY has the additional dependency of the [EnviroDIY version of the TinyGSM library](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/TinyGSM) for internet connectivity.

### Functions Available for a LoggerBase Object:
Timezone functions:
- **setTimeZone(int timeZone)** - Sets the timezone that you wish data to be logged in (in +/- hours from UTC).  This must always be set!
- **setTZOffset(int offset)** - This set the offset between the built-in clock and the timezone for the data.  If your RTC is set in UTC and your logging timezone is EST, this should be -5.  If your RTC is set in EST and your timezone are both EST this does not need to be called.
A note about timezones:  It is possible to create multiple logger objects in your code if you want to log different sensors at different intervals, but every logger object will always have the same timezone and timezone offset.  If you attempt to call these functions more than once for different loggers, whatever value was called last will apply to every logger.

Setup and initialization functions:
- **init(int SDCardPin, int interruptPin, int sensorCount, SensorBase SENSOR_LIST[], float loggingIntervalMinutes, const char loggerID = 0)** - Initializes the logger object.  Must happen within the setup function.  Note that the SENSOR_LIST[], loggerID are all pointers.
- **setAlertPin(int ledPin)** - Optionally sets a pin to put out an alert that a measurement is being logged.  This should be a pin with a LED on it.

Functions to access the clock in proper format and time zone:
- **getNow()** - This gets the current epoch time (unix timestamp - number of seconds since Jan 1, 1970) and corrects it for the specified logger time zone offset.
- **formatDateTime_ISO8601(DateTime dt)** - Formats a DateTime object into an ISO8601 formatted Arduino String.
- **formatDateTime_ISO8601(uint32_t unixTime)** - Formats a unix timestamp into an ISO8601 formatted Arduino String.
- **checkInterval()** - This returns true if the current time is an even iterval of the logging interval, otherwise false.  This uses getNow() to get the curernt time.
- **markTime()** - This sets variables for the date/time - this is needed so that all data outputs (SD, EnviroDIY, serial printing, etc) print the same time for updating the sensors - even though the routines to update the sensors and to output the data may take several seconds.  It is not currently possible to output the instantaneous time an individual sensor was updated, just a single marked time.  By custom, this should be called before updating the sensors, not after.  If you do not call this function before saving or sending data, there will be no timestamps associated with your data.


Functions for the timer and sleep modes:
- **setupTimer()** - Sets up the timer for repeated logging events.  This should be called in the setup function.
- **setupSleep()** - Sets up the sleep mode and interrupts to wake it back up.  This should be called in the setup function.
- **systemSleep()** - Puts the system into deep sleep mode.  This should be called at the very end of the loop function.

Functions for logging data:
- **setFileName(fileName)** - This sets a specifid file name for data to be saved as, if you want to decide on it in advance.  Note that you must include the file extention (ie., '.txt') in the file name.
- **setFileName()** - This automatically generates a csv file name from the logger id and the current date.  You must call one of the two setFileName functions before calling setupLogFile or logtoSD.
- **getFileName()** - This returns the current filename as an Arduino String.  Must be run after setFileName.
- **setupLogFile()** - This creates a file on the SD card and writes a header to it.  It also sets the "file created" time stamp.
- **logToSD(String rec)** - This writes a line the the SD card and sets the "file modified" timestamp.
- **generateFileHeader()** - This returns and Aruduino String with a comma separated list of headers for the csv.
- **generateSensorDataCSV()** - This returns an Arduino String containing the time and a comma separated list of sensor values.

Convience functions to do it all:
- **begin()** - Starts the logger.  Must be in the setup function.
- **log()** - Logs data, must be the entire content of the loop function.

### Additional Functions Available for a LoggerEnviroDIY Object:
Sending data to EnviroDIY depends on having some sort of modem or internet connection.  In our case, we're using "ModemSupport" bit of this library, which is essentially a wrapper for [TinyGSM](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/TinyGSM), to interface with the modem.  To make this work, you must add one of these lines _to the very top of your sketch_:
```cpp
// Select your modem chip, comment out all of the others
// #define TINY_GSM_MODEM_SIM800  // Select for anything using a SIM800, SIM900, or varient thereof: Sodaq GPRSBees, Microduino GPRS chips, Adafruit Fona, etc
// #define TINY_GSM_MODEM_A6  // Select for A6 or A7 chips
// #define TINY_GSM_MODEM_M590
// #define TINY_GSM_MODEM_ESP8266
#define TINY_GSM_MODEM_XBEE  // Select for Digi brand XBee's, including WiFi or LTE-M1
```
Any of the above modems types/chips should work, though only a SIM800 and WiFiBee have been tested to date.  If you would prefer to use a library of your own for controlling your modem, just omit the define statemnts.  In this case, the GSM library and modem support modules will be imported and you will lose the postDataEnviroDIY() and log() functions.
- These three functions set up the required registration token, sampling feature uuid, and time series uuids for the EnviroDIY streaming data loader API.  **All three** functions must be called before calling any of the other EnviroDIYLogger functions.  All of these values can be obtained after registering at http://data.envirodiy.org/.  You must call these functions to be able to get proper JSON data for EnviroDIY, even without the modem support.
    - **setToken(const char registrationToken)** - Sets the registration token to access the EnviroDIY streaming data loader API.  Note that the input is a pointer to the registrationToken.
    - **setSamplingFeature(const char samplingFeature)** - Sets the GUID of the sampling feature.  Note that the input is a pointer to the samplingFeature.
    - **setUUIDs(const char UUIDs[])** - Sets the time series UUIDs.  Note that the input is an array of pointers.  The order of the UUIDs in this array **must match exactly** with the order of the coordinating variable in the SENSOR_LIST.
- After registering the tokens, set up your modem using one of these two commands, depending on whether you are using cellular or WiFi communication
    - **modem.setupModem(Stream modemStream, int vcc33Pin, int status_CTS_pin, int onoff_DTR_pin, DTRSleepType sleepType, const char APN)** - Sets up the internet communcation with a cellular modem.  Note that the modemStream and APN should be pointers.  
    - **modem.setupModem(Stream modemStream, int vcc33Pin, int status_CTS_pin, int onoff_DTR_pin, DTRSleepType sleepType, const char ssid, const char pwd)** - Sets up the internet communcation with a WiFi modem.  Note that the modemStream, ssid, and password should be pointers.
    - The _DTRSleepType_ controls how the modem is put to sleep between readings.  Use "held" if the DTR pin is held HIGH to keep the modem awake, as with a Sodaq GPRSBee rev6.  Use "pulsed" if the DTR pin is pulsed high and then low to wake the modem up, as with an Adafruit Fona or Sodaq GPRSBee rev4.  Use "reverse" if the DTR pin is held LOW to keep the modem awake, as with all XBees.  Use "always_on" if you do not want the library to control the modem power and sleep.
- **generateSensorDataJSON()** - Generates a properly formatted JSON string to go to the EnviroDIY streaming data loader API.
- **postDataEnviroDIY()** - Creates proper headers and sends data to the EnviroDIY data portal.  Depends on the modem support module.  Returns an HTML response code.

### <a name="LoggerExamples"></a>Logger Examples:

To set up logging, you must first include the appropriate logging module and create a new logger instance.  This must happen outside of the setup and loop functions:

```cpp
// Import Logger Module
#include <LoggerBase.h>
// Create a new logger instance
LoggerBase Logger;
```

--OR--

```cpp
// Import Logger Module
#include <LoggerEnviroDIY.h>
// Create a new logger instance
LoggerEnviroDIY EnviroDIYLogger;
```

_Within the setup function_, you must then initialize the logger and then run the logger setup.  For the EnviroDIY logger, you must also set up the communication.  (Please note that these are show with default values.):

```cpp
// Set the time zone and offset from the RTC
Logger.setTimeZone(int timeZone);
Logger.setTZOffset(int offset);
// Initialize the logger;
Logger.init(int SDCardPin, int interruptPin,
            int sensorCount,
            SensorBase *SENSOR_LIST[],
            float loggingIntervalMinutes,
            const char *loggerID = 0);
// OPTIONAL - specify a pin to give an alert when a measurement is taken
// This should generally be a pin with an LED
setAlertPin(int ledPin);
// Begin the logger;
Logger.begin();
```

--OR--

```cpp
// Set the time zone and offset from the RTC
EnviroDIYLogger.setTimeZone(int timeZone);
EnviroDIYLogger.setTZOffset(int offset);
// Initialize the logger;
EnviroDIYLogger.init(int SDCardPin, int interruptPin,
                     int sensorCount,
                     SensorBase *SENSOR_LIST[],
                     float loggingIntervalMinutes,
                     const char *loggerID = 0);
// OPTIONAL - specify a pin to give an alert when a measurement is taken
// This should generally be a pin with an LED
setAlertPin(int ledPin);
// Set up the communication with EnviroDIY
EnviroDIYLogger.setToken(const char *registrationToken);
EnviroDIYLogger.setSamplingFeature(const char *samplingFeature);
EnviroDIYLogger.setUUIDs(const char *UUIDs[]);
EnviroDIYLogger.modem.setupModem(Stream *modemStream,
                                 int vcc33Pin,
                                 int status_CTS_pin,
                                 int onoff_DTR_pin,
                                 DTRSleepType sleepType,
                                 const char *APN);
// Run the logger setup;
EnviroDIYLogger.begin();
```

_Within the main loop function_, all logging and sending of data can be done using a single program line.  Because the built-in log functions already handle sleeping and waking the board processor, **there cannot be nothing else within the loop function.**
```cpp
void loop()
{
    Logger.log();
}
```

--OR--

```cpp
void loop()
{
    EnviroDIYLogger.log();
}
```
If you would like to do other things within the loop function, you should access the component logging functions individually instead of using the short-cut functions.  In this case, here are some guidelines for writing a loop function:
- If you want to log on an even interval, use "if (checkInterval()" to verify the interval time.
- Call the markTime() function before printing/sending/saving any data that you want associate with a timestamp.
- Update all the sensors in your SensorArray together with updateAllSensors().
- Immediately after running updateAllSensors(), put sensors to sleep to save power with sensorsSleep().
- After updating the sensors, then call any functions you want to send/print/save data.
- Finish by putting the logger back to sleep, if desired, with systemSleep().

You must have the [EnviroDIY modified version of SoftwareSerial](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/SoftwareSerial_PCINT12/) installed to use this sensor.  This modified version is needed so there are no pin change interrupt conflicts with the SDI-12 library or the software pin change interrupt library used to wake the clock.  Because of this, the MaxBotix must be installed on a digital pin that depends on pin change interrupt vector 1 or 2.  On the Mayfly, the empty pins in this range are pins D10, D11, and D18.  (Changing the solder jumper options on the back of the board may eliminate D18 as a possibility.)
